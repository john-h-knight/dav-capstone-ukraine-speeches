31 December 2022  - 23:55 ,New Year greetings of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Dear Ukrainians!, This year began on February 24. Without prefaces and preludes. Sharply. Early. At 4 o'clock., It was dark. It was loud. It was hard for many and scary for some. 311 days have passed. It can still be dark, loud, and complicated for us. But we will definitely never be afraid again. And we'll never be ashamed., It was our year. Year of Ukraine. Year of Ukrainians., We woke up on February 24. Into another life. Being another people. Another Ukrainians. The first missiles finally destroyed the labyrinth of illusions. We saw who was who. What friends and enemy are capable of, and most importantly, what we are capable of., On February 24, millions of us made a choice. Not a white flag, but a blue and yellow flag. Not escaping, but meeting. Meeting the enemy. Resisting and fighting., The explosions on February 24 stunned us. Since then we have not heard everything. And we don't listen to everyone. We were told: you have no other option but to surrender. We say: we have no other option than to win., On February 24, we began to create our victory. From many bricks – hundreds of other victories., We have overcome the panic. We did not run away but united. We have overcome doubts, despair, and fear. We believed in ourselves and in our strength. The Armed Forces of Ukraine. Intelligence. National Guard. SBU. Special Operations Forces. Border guards. Territorial defense forces. Air defense forces. The police. The State Emergency Service. All our defense and security forces. I am proud of you all, our warriors!, This year can be called a year of losses for Ukraine, for the whole of Europe, and the whole world. But it's wrong. We shouldn't say that., We haven't lost anything. It was taken from us. Ukraine did not lose its sons and daughters – they were taken away by murderers. Ukrainians did not lose their homes – they were destroyed by terrorists. We did not lose our lands – they were occupied by invaders. The world did not lose peace – Russia destroyed it., This year has struck our hearts. We've cried out all the tears. All the prayers have been yelled. 311 days. We have something to say about every minute. But most of the words are superfluous. They are not needed. No explanations or decorations are needed. Silence is needed to hear. Pauses are needed to realize., The morning of February 24., Hostomel. Bucha. Irpin. Borodianka. Kharkiv.
 Mriya., Kramatorsk Station. Toy., Chernihiv., Mariupol. Drama Theater. The word ""Children"" written., Olenivka., Odesa. Multi-story building. Girl. Three months old., Vilniansk. Maternity hospital. Baby. Two days old., Azovstal., It's impossible to forget. And it's impossible to forgive. But it's possible to win., We stood on our feet because there was something that kept us going. Our spirit., Defense of Kyiv., Kharkiv., Mykolaiv., Chornobayivka., Snake Island., HIMARS., Antonivsky Bridge., ""Cotton"" pops., Crimean Bridge., Neptune., Cruiser Moskva., Russian warship., Izyum, Balakliya and Kupyansk., Kherson., And we pray that there will be Kreminna and Svatove, Melitopol, all of Donbas, Crimea., We fight and will continue to fight. For the sake of the main word: ""victory."", It will be for sure. We are approaching it for 311 days., We gave it a lot of strength. But at the moment, when it seems that you can't go any further, remember that we have already passed with you., I want to say to all of you: Ukrainians, you are incredible! See what we have done and what we are doing!, How our soldiers have been smashing this ""second army of the world"" since the first days., How our people stopped their equipment and infantry columns., How an old man used his hands to stop a tank., How a woman knocked down a drone with a jar of tomatoes., How enemy tanks, armored personnel carriers, helicopters, shells were stolen during the occupation., How we fundraised for Shahed hunters, naval drones, armored vehicles, ambulance vehicles and Bayraktar drones in several hours., How we withstood all threats, shelling, cluster bombs, cruise missiles, darkness and cold., How we supported each other and the state., Everyone is important in war., Who holds a weapon, the steering wheel of a car, the helm of a ship or plane, a scalpel, or a pointer., Everyone who is behind a laptop, who drives a combine harvester, a train., Who is at a roadblock and a power plant., Journalists and diplomats, utility workers and rescuers., All. Who is working. Studying at a university or school. And even those who are just learning to walk., All this is for their sake. Our children. Our people. Our country., There are no small matters in a great war. There are no unnecessary ones. Each of us is a fighter. Each of us is a front. Each of us is the basis of the defense., We fight as one team – the whole country, all our regions. I admire you all. I want to thank every invincible region of Ukraine., Kharkiv. Mutilated but unconquered. You proved to the enemy that being close territorially does not mean being close in mind. Kharkiv is a Ukrainian city. The hero city., Invincible Mykolaiv. Heroically withstands all blows. The city on a wave that overcomes all storms., Sumy city and the region. You were one of the first to feel the full-scale invasion of the invaders. Sumy region became a bone in their throat for them. Ordinary people made Molotov cocktails, burned enemy columns, took the first prisoners. Sumy region is a force., Dnipro. The support and reliable rear of our front. You received people, you got the lives of wounded soldiers back. Despite constant barrages, Dnipro lives on., Odesa. Sunny and friendly, now a fortress. World fortress. Which defends us and which defends the world. Feeds it by sending millions of tonnes of salvation by sea every day. Because it is Odesa Mama., Kherson! You are heroic people! You have been under occupation for more than eight months. No news. No communication. Separated from Ukraine., Thousands of you took part in actions against the ruscists. You did not know whether we saw it in Ukraine or knew about it. The occupiers lied to you that Ukraine abandoned you and would not fight for you. But you believed and waited despite everything. The face of Kherson is cut by fragments of shells, but the main thing is that we welcome the New Year free and together under blue and yellow flags. And therefore, we will restore everything, rebuild everything. Just like Chernihiv and Zaporizhzhia, and Kramatorsk, and Bakhmut., Those that became a refuge for millions of Ukrainians: Rivne, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil, Vinnytsia. I thank you! Those who receive and transfer millions of tonnes of aid from Europe and the world: Lviv, Uzhgorod, Chernivtsi, Lutsk. Thank you! Those who accept the evacuation of businesses, enterprises, universities: Khmelnytsky, Zhytomyr, Kropyvnytsky, Poltava, Cherkasy. Thank you!, And those who are waiting for Ukraine. And will wait. Donbas, Luhansk region, Crimea. Thanks to you, our warriors!, And, of course, Kyiv region and the city are our heart, which always beats thanks to you, all our Ukrainians!, We are all one family. One Ukraine., This is the year when Ukraine changed the world. And the world discovered Ukraine. We were told to surrender. We chose a counterattack! We were told to make concessions and compromises. We are joining the European Union and NATO., The world heard Ukraine. European Parliament, Bundestag, the UK Parliament, Knesset, the US Congress., The world felt Ukraine. Ukraine in the media. In the hearts of people. At the top of Google search., The world saw Ukraine. On the main squares in Toronto, New York, London, Warsaw, Florence, Sydney, and other cities., Ukrainians surprise. Ukrainians are applauded. Ukrainians inspire., Is there anything that can scare us? No. Is there anyone who can stop us? No., Because we are all together., It is what we are fighting for. One for each other., The best salute for us is at the warehouses of the occupiers. The best gift is the numbers in the report of the General Staff., We do not know for sure what the new year 2023 will bring us. But ready for anything., New achievements? We will be happy. New hits? We will be steadfast. Continuation of the fight? We will fight. And when we win, we will hug., Dear Ukrainians!, A few minutes remain until the New Year. I want to wish all of us one thing – victory. And that's the main thing. One wish for all Ukrainians., Let this year be the year of return. The return of our people. Soldiers – to their families. Prisoners – to their homes. Immigrants – to their Ukraine., Return of our lands. And the temporarily occupied will become forever free., Return to normal life. To happy moments without curfew. To earthly joys without air alerts., The return of what has been stolen from us. The childhood of our children, the peaceful old age of our parents., So that grandchildren come to visit their grandparents during the holidays. To eat watermelons in Kherson. And the cherry in Melitopol., So that our cities are free. Our friends are faithful., And so that our main figure and main success appeared in reports near the figure of 100,000 destroyed enemies, thousands of units of destroyed Russian equipment – it is 603,628 square kilometers. The area of independent Ukraine, as it was since 1991. As it will always be., May the New Year bring all this. We are ready to fight for it. That's why each of us is here. I'm here. We are here. You are here. Everyone is here. We are all Ukraine., Glory to Ukraine!, Happy New Year!,

31 December 2022  - 17:49 ,"The terrorist state won't be forgiven, and those who give orders and carry out strikes will not receive a pardon – address of the President of Ukraine",", December 31st... Today, this Russian missile attack is not the end of the year, no matter how much the terrorists want it. It's the outcome of Russia's fate., The terrorist state will not be forgiven. And those who give orders for such strikes, and those who carry them out, will not receive a pardon. To put it mildly., Several missile attack waves on New Year's Day. Missiles against people. It's against the people., NONhumans did it, NONhumans will lose. And you and I know it. Terrorists cannot change it., At Easter, they made such attacks, at Christmas, at New Year... They call themselves Christians, they are very proud of their Orthodoxy. But they are following the devil. They support him and are together with him., And I'll tell you about it in Russian., All this war that you are waging, you are Russia, it is not the war with NATO, as your propagandists lie. It is not for something historical. It's for one person to remain in power until the end of his life. And what will be with all of you, citizens of Russia, does not concern him., Your leader wants to show that he has the troops behind him and that he is ahead. But he is just hiding. He hides behind the troops, behind missiles, behind the walls of his residences and palaces., He hides behind you and burns your country and your future. No one will ever forgive you for terror. No one in the world will forgive you for this. Ukraine will never forgive., And you yourself will not forgive him everything that he will destroy and everyone whom he will kill., Citizen of Ukraine!, All our services work where there were missile hits. We provide assistance to those affected. Kyiv, Khmelnytsky, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv this time..., Unfortunately, there are casualties... My condolences to the families., Most of the missiles have been intercepted by our air defense forces. And these are lives saved. If it were not for air defense, the number of casualties would have been different. Much bigger. And this is yet another proof for the world that support for Ukraine must be increased., I thank all the partners who helped with the air defense. IRIS-T, Crotale, NASAMS, Hawk. MANPADS Perun, Mistral, etc. Next year it will be Patriot. This year, a lot of S-300s were made, which we also received., Each of these systems is a counter to terror, it's what proves the strength of normal people and the ineffectiveness of terrorists. A weapon against terror is a means for peace., And every day – today is no exception – we release our people. A total of 140 people were returned from Russian captivity today. 22 officers, 118 privates and sergeants. In total, since February 24, we have returned home 1,596 Ukrainian men and women., Thanks to our team! Thanks to everyone who protects Ukraine! To everyone who is now on the front line! Thanks to everyone who fights for our country!, Thanks to Air Defense Forces! And please, citizens, don't ignore the sirens. Thanks to our energy workers - everyone who removes the consequences of terrorist attacks., It will be the New Year now., We'll be in touch with you the whole time!, We are all working., Glory to Ukraine!,

30 December 2022  - 19:46 ,"In the new year Ukrainian air defense will become stronger, more effective – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, I held another meeting of the Staff – already the 45th this year., The main thing is Donetsk region, Luhansk region – our Donbas, where the fiercest battles are going on. Bakhmut, Soledar, Kreminna... In general, we hold our positions. There are also areas of the front where we are slowly advancing. And I thank all our soldiers who ensure this. You are real heroes!, We discussed the situation in the south, on our border, the supply of weapons, and the further strengthening of air defense., This year, we not only maintained our air defenses, but we made them stronger than ever. But in the new year Ukrainian air defense will become even stronger, even more effective., Ukrainian air defense can become the most powerful in Europe, and this will be a guarantee of security not only for our country, but also for the entire continent., After the meeting of the Staff, at a separate meeting we discussed the situation in the energy industry, what we are preparing for., We have a clear strategy for ensuring the generation and supply of electricity. It takes time to implement it. It takes a lot of effort. But it will be. It will be mandatory. It is one of the most important tasks for the next year, and I have no doubt that we will accomplish it., Today I spoke with the Prime Minister of Greece. We summarized the year, and I thanked Greece for supporting our country. We agreed for next year how we can make cooperation even more meaningful., I held a meeting with our diplomats. There are many questions, but the main thing is the measures we are preparing to strengthen Ukraine already in January and February., Ukraine will retain the achieved leadership in foreign policy and will be even more active, that's for sure., And one more., Today, for the first time, the ceremony of awarding our volunteers with the Golden Heart took place., It is fair and honest – at the end of the year, to recognize those who help our defense, help people and our entire state all year long., Thank you to everyone who fights for our country. Who helps Ukrainians. Who works for Ukraine and our future., Glory to all our people!, Glory to Ukraine!,  "
29 December 2022  - 22:54 ,Every Russian missile only confirms that all this must end with a tribunal - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, First of all, I want to thank our Air Forces servicemen, Ukrainian air defense, which successfully repelled another Russian attack today. , 54 missiles and 11 attack drones were shot down., Our warriors all over Ukraine distinguished themselves, and I thank all our Air Commands: Center, South, East and West., And especially we are grateful to the warriors of the 96th Kyiv, 160th Odesa, 208th Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigades, whose results are the best today., Unfortunately, there were several hits. Our power engineers and repair crews are doing everything to make Ukrainians feel the consequences of the terrorists' strike as little as possible. And I thank everyone who is working to restore energy supply., As of this evening, there are power outages in most regions of Ukraine. It is especially difficult in Kyiv region and the capital, Lviv region, Odesa and the region, Kherson and the region, Vinnytsia region and Zakarpattia., But this is nothing compared to what could have happened, if it was not for our heroic anti-aircraft troops and air defense., With each such missile strike, Russia is only driving itself deeper into a dead end. They have fewer and fewer missiles. Instead, the status of the biggest terrorist in the world will have consequences for Russia and its citizens for a long time. And each missile only confirms that all this must end with a tribunal. And that is exactly what will happen., And despite all the strikes, the state works every day. The Office, the Cabinet of Ministers - everyone is working., In particular, today I had two large meetings, economic and defense. We are working to ensure that our defenders have more opportunities, more weapons, more drones., The situation on the frontline remained without significant changes over the last day., The most acute situation is in Bakhmut, Soledar, over the entire line in the Donetsk region. The enemy has not abandoned the insane idea to capture the Donetsk region... Now they set themselves a task - for the New Year., I am grateful to all our guys who have been proving to the occupiers for months that it is us who will set and achieve goals on our land., I am grateful to everyone who defends the Ukrainian Donbas! To all who defend our Kharkiv region! To all who keep our south! Who protect our border... , And, by the way, I thank those border guards who, together with all the defense forces, are fighting the enemy at the front. I thank the warriors of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi and Mukachevo border guard detachments., Dear Ukrainians! , There are two days left in this year. Perhaps, the enemy will try once again to make us celebrate the New Year in darkness. Perhaps, the occupiers are planning to make us suffer with the next strikes at our cities. , But no matter what they plan, we know one thing about ourselves: we will endure. For sure. We will drive them out. No doubts about that. And they will face punishment for this terrible war. The maximum punishment., I thank everyone who defends our state! I thank everyone who fights for our independence!, Glory to Ukraine!"
28 December 2022  - 22:18 ,"No matter what is happening and what is on your mind, be sure to support each other - address by the President of Ukraine",", I wish you health, dear Ukrainians!, Today - so it turned out - is the day of summing up this year and plans for the next year., I held a meeting with officials specializing in international relations regarding events and plans for January., I met with the Minister of Defense of France who arrived in Ukraine. We discussed cooperation over the year, the reconstruction of our country and another step in strengthening our air defense. Thank you, France!, I met with government officials and heads of parliamentary committees. We discussed the solutions that are being prepared., Today, I also delivered the annual Message to the Verkhovna Rada on the external and internal situation of Ukraine. About how we all - all Ukrainians - changed the world this year and what we will do next year., Probably, you could already see the highlights of all these events in the news, or you will see them., I would like to add one more thing to everything that was done and said today. Add something non-political., No matter what is happening and what is on your mind, support each other. Necessarily., Please take the time to say kind words to those close to you. Even if these are not people close to you - just to other Ukrainians., Please find an opportunity and a moment to thank for the work, to praise for this or that effort, for the care., And if a person is in such a difficult situation, at such a difficult time, remains alone and for some reason does not have relatives, please ask if he or she needs help. Or just help without even asking., If you know that a person is waiting for a son or daughter from the war, please pay attention: say hello, listen, help., Hug your family more often. Tell your friends more often how much you appreciate them. Support colleagues more often. Thank your parents more often. Rejoice with children more often., Do not forget to call when relatives are waiting, even just to hear: how are you? Do not forget to write messages to friends and acquaintances at least sometimes - you should not lose contact now., And please don't forget to say thank you when you've been helped. Please try to support those who fight for our country., Our attention to others, when it may be lacking from one of our relatives - for various reasons, our words that can warm those around us when events are too cold, and our care for each other when circumstances are challenging - all this is also our common defense., We have not lost our humanity even though we have gone through terrible months. And we will not lose it even though there is also a difficult year ahead. We will reach victory. And we have to do it really together., Take care of Ukraine, appreciate each other and do everything to help our warriors! , Every day - until victory., Glory to all our people! , Glory to Ukraine!"
28 December 2022  - 18:51 ,Speech by the President with the annual message to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on the internal and external situation of Ukraine,", Glory to Ukraine!, Dear Mr. Chairman, dear people's deputies of our strong Ukraine, dear government officials!, Dear guests, dear attendees!, Dear Ukrainian warriors!, Ukrainian people!, Let's talk about Ukraine today., About how everyone has changed in these 10 months. And about how we changed the whole world., About our strength., All this time we were one. Just like now in this hall, when everyone answered - ""Glory to the heroes""., Glory to Ukraine!, Due to our unity, we have achieved what almost no one in the world, in the whole world, believed in. Almost no one except us., Ukraine has become one of the global leaders., Our national colors are today an international symbol of courage and indomitability of the whole world. In any country, on any continent, when they see blue and yellow, they know that it is about freedom. About the people who did not give up, who endured, who united the world. And who will win., Thanks to Ukraine, the world believed that values give strength. This belief emerged following our struggle. The world became convinced that tyranny will lose. Following our faith. The world saw that freedom can be victorious. Following our achievements on the battlefield. And all our warriors., It will definitely happen. , Ukraine will definitely win., In 10 months of this year, we helped everyone. We helped the West find itself again, return to the global arena and feel how much the West prevails. No one in the West is afraid of Russia anymore and will never be., We helped the European Union acquire real agency. We helped Europe feel like not several championships with teams of different levels, but one strong team that, together with the whole free world, is fighting for this important victory., It was Ukraine that united the European Union. It turned out that it is possible!, And now Europe defends itself. Europe overcomes crises. And this is despite the colossal resources thrown by Russia to break our continent., Everything that Russia tried to do against Europe did not work. Every Russian step was a mistake., And our steps did work., And for the first time in history, the European Union is helping to defend against such large-scale aggression. For the first time, a number of EU countries have changed their legislation and political rules and are now providing armed support to our state., For the first time in history, some European countries have reconsidered the concept of neutrality and resist aggression together with us, together with Ukraine., We helped Europe and most of the world feel that being neutral now is, pardon me, immoral. 143 states voted for the resolution of the UN General Assembly in support of the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the full implementation of the UN Charter., This is a really striking example. This is the biggest number in 10 months and 8 years. And I thank everyone who worked for this result. Unprecedentedly actively. Congratulations! This is a great victory!, During this time after February 24, I alone had 850 international events. And this is how our entire diplomatic corps worked., Now I want to thank everyone who worked just like that, just as powerfully. All our diplomats, all our government officials and, of course, those people's deputies who helped the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Office build a pro-Ukrainian coalition in the world. I thank you!, And I am thankful to all the leaders and nations who help us defend our independence, protect international law! Thank you to the honorable ambassadors of the countries - partners of ours, who are now present here, in this distinguished hall!, Fellow Ukrainians!, Look at how global priorities have changed., Most of the countries of the world are no longer interested in whether Russia will hear them. That's no longer the case., Now the world is really interested in what else to expect from Ukraine, what else Ukraine can give to Europe, what we can give to the world., For many people in the world, it is now pride to have friends among Ukrainians. Remember how Ukrainians once wanted to have friends among foreigners., And now we are truly one with the world - with the strongest, with the freest in the world., We restore faith in values to millions of people in different countries. In the values that parents teach their children anywhere in the free world. We show that life should really depend on such values., We actualize the meanings. Meanings that were, unfortunately, only barren letters of some international agreements, conventions and memoranda for a long time. They will work. And we show it., We give each of our partners a unique and very important feeling and a historic opportunity - to be a winner together with Ukraine., Thanks to Ukrainians, the world remembers what it means to be winners., Next year we will only strengthen it., This year, we obtained for Ukraine the status of a candidate for joining the European Union. But our achievement is not only in this. This is only part of the achievement. Ukraine has long deserved this status. We know. Even 20 years ago, we could have been there, with this status., Now our achievement is much greater., Ukraine cements., It cements the European Union and the entire free world with the struggle for freedom and peace., This is our main achievement in foreign policy for the past year., We made it obvious to everyone that no union in Europe would be strong without Ukraine., And that is why in all the countries of the European Union, a clear majority of citizens supported Ukraine and the idea of Ukraine joining the EU, and the majority sees us in the Alliance., It is time to start negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union., Fellow Ukrainians!, I want us now to thank all those who opened this opportunity and this path to us., I want us to thank our warriors. Warriors!, Our warriors, exactly warriors, Ukrainian heroes, are not just servicemen. Not just soldiers and sailors, not just sergeants, not just officers and generals., The warriors are the hope of millions of people for life. They are Europe's hope for peace. They are the hope of the world that the time of empires cannot return., Ukrainian warriors gain peace for us., And they will gain it!, Glory to the Armed Forces of Ukraine! To the National Guard, our border guards, our intelligence, Security Service, Special Operations Forces, National Police! Glory to all our Defense and Security Forces! Glory to Ukraine!, Today, the Ukrainian warriors prove that greatness does not depend on the size of the state, the stockpile of missiles, or the ability to force someone into something., Greatness depends on the strength of morale of those who defend their home, defend the freedom of their people., The Ukrainian warriors ousted the invaders from around Kyiv, and this was the first turning point in the full-scale war. It showed the strength of our resistance., The Ukrainian warriors freed Zmiinyi, and since then every occupier knows the only answer he will hear from the Ukrainians to any of his encroachments. This showed that nothing can stop Ukraine., The number of flagships has somewhat decreased in the Black Sea, and one infamous bridge is increasingly operating for exit rather than entry. If it is operating, of course. And it showed what the future would be like. It will be Ukrainian., The active actions of our Defense and Security Forces in the Kharkiv region turned many pages of old history. Perhaps, the Russian army did not know that it was capable of fleeing so quickly. Fleeing, leaving everything behind - positions, weapons, their soldiers and collaborators., The occupiers fled, although they had an advantage in this direction - in the number of weapons, equipment and soldiers. But our warriors had - and have - another great advantage. , A more significant one. , The advantage in determination, the advantage of the strength of your land under your feet., We reinforce this advantage of Ukrainian warriors with powerful weapons. We have such weapons for the first time., HIMARS and Krab, Harpoon and NASAMS, Bayraktar and M777 howitzers, CAESAR, Bushmaster, IRIS-T, Crotale - I have named only a few of the dozens of types of the best weapons in the world, which our warriors already have or will have. I am grateful to our partners!, We have already managed to liberate more than one thousand eight hundred cities and villages of Ukraine from the Russian occupier., And I thank all the states that help us overcome Russian tyranny right on the battlefield!, And let me remind you that a year ago it seemed impossible that our country would have Patriot air defense systems. Now we have such an agreement. I am grateful to our strategic partners!, This is a special sign of trust in Ukraine., This is a true alliance with the United States of America. We have achieved this., And I have a debt after my visit to the United States, which I want to pay off right now., Captain Pavlo Cherniavskyi is now in this hall, commander of the HIMARS battery who was awarded the Cross of Combat Merit and who presented this award to President of the United States of America Biden., It was an honor to carry out this special mission. But it also has a second part. In response, President Biden handed over a Command Coin – a special symbol from the President of the United States of America., Mr. Captain! Pavlo!, I have to give this Command Coin to you now., Once again, I want to thank President Biden, both parties of Congress and every American family for the historical support of Ukraine and our citizens. Thank you!, Fellow Ukrainians!, You see, dear Ukrainians, how the whole world helps us and how we get advanced weapons., Rest assured, the time will come when the whole world will be equally interested in Ukrainian weapons brands. , We are capable of producing our missiles, our naval drones, we are already doing it, armored vehicles, aircraft and other types of weapons. We are already doing it. There is ours already., It's all ours. ""Stugna"", ""Vilkha"", ""Neptune"", marine drone and others., Let's thank our domestic production., Ukraine and the Ukrainian military-industrial complex was and will be one of the most powerful in Europe and the world, I am sure of that., The intensity of hostilities, the depth of the evil that Russia has brought, the volume and brutality of the crimes of the occupiers on our Ukrainian land encourage not only us, but also the whole world to update defense standards, update security standards, and achieve justice., And this applies to many areas., From the production of projectiles and tactics on the battlefield to the creation of a new effective security architecture for Ukraine, for all of Europe and the world, new security guarantees., From the launch of legal mechanisms to bring to justice all those guilty of aggression and to compensate at the expense of Russia for all the damage caused by this terror, to the reform of existing international organizations that are supposed to guarantee peace, guarantee international law and order, but are unable to do so now., Ukraine is already among the leaders of the relevant processes., And, by the way, it is in Ukraine that new NATO standards are defined by our heroic warriors. Standards we share with our allies today. Allies! Not just partners., But in order to get to that time and those opportunities, we have to come to an agreement between ourselves now., All of us in this hall, in Ukraine, within our people, our society., The first point is unity. We have to cherish it despite any personal emotions, any personal interests., Unity is what allows us now to strengthen society, strengthen our state, win together and change the negative trends of our centuries-old history., The stronger the unity, the greater and faster our victory will be., We must be equal in unity. Equal in unity. And this is now a challenge. A very important point., No one at the front will understand those who, having any political weight or any position of authority, will try to return to the old life. Life before February 24., And if someone tries to play against the independence of Ukraine - be it political, economic, or spiritual independence - our state will respond instantly and in a tough way., There is no such gold for crosses or anything else in the world that could cover the moral rust from ties with a terrorist state., And if someone from the political class of Ukraine thinks that when he skis down the mountain, he motivates the soldiers to climb out of the trenches and go on the offensive, this is a sign of madness, and there will be no such people in politics., I urge everyone to leave their personal ambitions at home and work to protect our common home., Work together with the state and in a way that is necessary to protect freedom and our people., When such a brutal war is ongoing, it is not the time for personal political guerrilla activity somewhere in the rear, in the media, or even more so in the capitals of the countries that help us., Please take my words as seriously as possible., Ukraine is on its way to the victory that generations of our people have dreamed of. Now our children dream of it. Our parents and grandparents dreamed of it. All generations from the time of Bohdan to the national liberation struggle of the XX century., We will get what we did not achieve before. We will. , And this is possible thanks to the fact that for the first time in several centuries we simultaneously have national unity, our own functioning state and the maximum unity of the world in supporting our beautiful Ukraine., We will not let anyone ""roll it back"" to the old days. People will not allow it. The world will not allow it. , Our unity must be as strong as our warriors., The second point is security., Being one of the global leaders is not a status or an award. This is an ongoing process. The process of finding new opportunities for our state, new friends and alliances, new growth for the economy and for our society., In the same way, the security of the state is not a state that you achieve once and for all, it is difficult work, it is a process., Leadership and security always go hand in hand - by acquiring one, you work for the other., Now, when the enemy has set himself the goal of destroying us, destroying our energy sector, we set ourselves the goal of becoming a leader in the transformation of our energy sector to counter any threats, any challenges - military, political, economic or even climatic., We have to become - and we will become, as there is no other option - a leader in building modern green energy. This will allow us to create a decentralized energy system that cannot be destroyed by anything, any missile strikes., Today - everyone can see - it is dangerous when cities depend on several large thermal or power plants. A modern city needs decentralized sources of energy., Only green energy can really provide this., Having a leadership position in such energy and developing our atomic generation, as well as hydrogen energy, we will be able to provide for the needs of Ukraine, and in peacetime - the needs of Europe., And this will be a historic strengthening of Ukraine's role in Europe. We can, and therefore must, become one of the guarantors of European energy security. And this is a task, a task for tomorrow., And today we have to get through and we will definitely get through this winter., Russian missile and, as they say, ""shahed"" strikes at our energy sector, at the energy supply of Ukrainians, is an obvious challenge not only to our state, by the way., When terror strikes against the civilization of life, the world can stand up for both civilization and life., We do everything for this., I want to thank everyone who advocates for increasing international pressure on Russia for this terror!, And I thank all the countries and companies, international organizations and people who supply us with equipment and provide financial support to provide the people of Ukraine with light, heat and communication! Thank you!, One example - we will increase the number of Starlink terminals in Ukraine, which clearly prove the superiority of civilization over terror and barbarism, to more than thirty thousand in the near future., We are already becoming - and we will become - a leader in the digital transformation of our state and society., I think it is not necessary to dwell separately on what we have achieved in the field of digitization and communication., I will only say that this is an achievement of such importance that allows us to make our country's experience in digitization one of the tools of foreign policy., We will complete the total digitization of all permits and public services in Ukraine. This is about anti-corruption and about the stability of the institutions of our state., And what is important, by spreading such experience of transformation, successful experience in the world, we will provide Ukraine with new friends, new alliances, new political and economic opportunities., In particular, this will concern the development of relations with African countries and other states of the Global South. This direction of foreign policy received a special priority., We are already becoming - and we will become - the leader of global efforts for food security., This year has shown that without a Ukrainian farmer, without Ukrainian agricultural exports, it is impossible to guarantee not only food, but also social security for dozens of countries in Africa, Asia and Europe. Our two initiatives - the Export Grain Initiative and the ""Grain from Ukraine"" program - have returned the world to vital stability., More than fifteen million tons of food for export to more than forty countries of the world in just five months in conditions of full-scale war is our first grain initiative., And I want to thank the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Guterres, I thank President of Türkiye Erdoğan for supporting the restoration of our agricultural exports., Already more than thirty donor countries and almost two hundred million dollars - this is our second grain initiative, a humanitarian one. The European Union and Qatar, Türkiye and Japan, Norway and Korea, Canada and the United States of America - this is just the beginning of the global humanitarian corridor for countries facing the threat of famine., Famine caused by Russia., Even now, when it's hard for us, we share our Ukrainian bread with those for whom it is even harder. I thank you for this - everyone who did it! This moral leadership of Ukraine and our partners is undeniable., Ukraine must always look for ways to show leadership, to attract other leaders, and every such success will strengthen our security, strengthen the external situation of our state., But also the internal one., Our export initiatives and, in general, the expansion of opportunities for freight transportation through the territory of the European Union, Türkiye - allowed us to save millions of jobs for Ukrainians., Dear attendees!, I am asking you now to thank all our transporters, all our port workers, all those who work on the railways, in every other industry that ensures the movement of goods for Ukrainians!, Another important security element., Business is also the protection of Ukraine now. Taxes are also security now., This year we had no delays - or almost no delays - with the salaries of our beloved teachers and doctors. Pensions were indexed, as provided by the legislation of Ukraine. In the de-occupied territory, payments were made as soon as stabilization measures were completed there. More than one trillion two hundred billion hryvnias are allocated to defense for the year., Of course, the financial assistance of partners and other involved funds played an important role, that's true., But., But there is a but. We must remember that the financing of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is primarily an internal resource from Ukrainian taxes, customs duties, bonds and other similar sources. , And every unpaid hryvnia of taxes is money taken from our military. This is the fact., Of course, the existing tax system is convenient neither for those who pay taxes nor for those who collect taxes. It is also not convenient for those of our people who receive salaries and pensions from these taxes. , But it is extremely important for us to reach a national agreement on this issue., Now I want to thank everyone who keeps their businesses running, who keeps jobs so that people can provide for themselves and their families, who pays taxes. Gratitude to all of you!, I want to emphasize this again and want you all to know: very important international aid goes to important social benefits. And the entire resource for the salaries of the military is paid by the citizens of Ukraine., The third point is justice., The creation of the Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression is an integral part of the policy of our state. I am sure that the Tribunal will work., The International compensation mechanism, which we are currently building, will also work., At the same time, we must cooperate as much as possible with our international partners, with the International Criminal Court., That is, all elements of international and national justice will be used to bring to justice the Russian murderers and torturers, all those who planned, started and are carrying out aggression against the people of Ukraine., No crime committed by the occupiers in Ukraine can go unpunished., And no matter how much resources and time it takes, accountability for the occupiers must be unavoidable., And it will be so!, For everything that was done against Ukraine, that was done against Ukrainians from 2014 and from February 24., Can the state alone ensure this? No., And I want to thank our partners, in particular, the Netherlands, for their principled leadership in this work; all our investigators, experts, prosecutors, all our judges who are already working on this, and all journalists and public activists who joined justice. Thank you!, I am also thankful to those who help us find and block the assets of the terrorist state and its associated persons in foreign jurisdictions, who promote important legislative initiatives in other states to confiscate these assets of the Russian Federation, and also advocate this in the media!, We will do everything to bring home all our people who are currently in Russian captivity., The goal of restoring the territorial integrity of Ukraine always goes hand in hand for us with another goal of freeing all our people who are held in Russian captivity or in prisons, as well as all those who were forcibly deported from our land., After February 24, our team managed to free 1,456 people from Russian captivity., This is significant. I am happy to see everyone who returns to Ukraine., But there is much more work ahead., However, I have no doubt that we will fulfill it together, in a united manner., Reconstruction of Ukraine after hostilities is another component of justice., It is already clear that this will be the biggest economic project of our time in Europe. The scope of what needs to be done is obvious to everyone and requires a separate enumeration now., I will mention very briefly only the key principles., The entire territory of our state needs reconstruction of those infrastructure, energy, social sphere and other objects that do not meet modern security requirements., We have to raise from the ruins the territory entered by the Russian invaders after February 24., In the same way, we will restore the normality of life in the territory of Donbas and Crimea, which were illegally occupied in 2014 and have been brought to the point of disaster by the occupiers over the time that has passed., Now it is still difficult to estimate the required amount of resources., But it can be said for sure that we should prioritize the restoration of those companies that were in Ukraine or that came to Ukraine during the war. Which left the Russian market during the war., And this is fair., Who supported us in the most difficult moments, who were with us when Ukraine was fighting for life, who worked, who paid taxes, who volunteered, who helped our indomitability... We need to find a format to give such business more opportunities in such important projects, the projects of a new, rebuilt Ukraine., Ukrainian business, American, French, Polish - any that we see - here and now., And I ask you, dear people's deputies, together with us, together with the Office, together with the Government to develop such a legislative framework. And this will also, I think, encourage international business to enter Ukraine now - preparing for the future, for the victory., And one more thing., Just as we must restore territorial integrity, we must also restore social integrity., Millions of our people who have become displaced persons, who have found shelter abroad, should not become refugees., I thank all the countries, I thank all the nations of Europe and the world who help our people!, But we must preserve them as a part of Ukrainian society. We have to ensure their return. And this includes various components of work., Security guarantees, economic growth., Reconstruction and further integration of our state with the European Union and other leading subjects of the free world., Protection of human rights, equalization of social and personal freedoms in Ukraine and in advanced countries of stay of our migrants., Creating a modern veteran policy. It’s very important!, Creation of a modern rehabilitation system in Ukraine for those who were put in the most difficult position by the war. So that our society has this feeling that no one is needless among us - this is the task... That we care about all Ukrainians, that we can help each and every one of them., A country that supports every its citizen is a country that you want to return to., We have to make sure that when the world sees the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag of ours, they will know that it is about freedom and about people who have a strong home and who will always be helped - no matter what happens to them., Because we are all Ukrainians. And that's enough., I thank you for your attention!, Glory to all who fight and work for our country! Glory to all who help us protect our independence, our freedom! Glory to all of you, our people!, Glory to Ukraine!, I wish all of us victory and only victory in the coming year. Nothing else is needed! Happy upcoming holidays. Thank you all for this difficult year! We thank our warriors, our people of beautiful Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
27 December 2022  - 22:21 ,We are entering the next year and must retain a common understanding of national goals - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, I held a meeting of the Staff today - the 44th of this year already. The topic is clear. First of all, it is Bakhmut, Kreminna and Donbas in general. Possible actions of the enemy in the eastern direction and our actions., We listened to the commanders, decided on steps for the near future. We continue to prepare the defense and security forces of Ukraine for the next year. It must be a crucial year. We understand the risks in the winter, we understand what we have to do in the spring, and therefore we understand what results the entire defense and security sector must demonstrate., The supply of ammunition and the repair of military equipment was discussed separately., By the way, I want to thank our specialists, all our partners, everyone involved in the relevant work. We managed to establish a system to not only return repaired equipment to the battlefield, but also to take trophy equipment from the battlefield and put it at the service of our country., This is a very important result of the year, everyone involved did a great job., I spoke today with the Prime Minister of Italy. I thanked for the support already provided and for the new support., Mrs. Meloni said that the issue of air defense for Ukraine is currently under consideration and we have coordinated our steps. I believe that Italian support will allow us to strengthen the defense of the Ukrainian sky., Of course, we also discussed our diplomatic plans for the coming months. And also the winter threats, which I am sure we will overcome together., I held a meeting today regarding the work of the banking system and our cooperation with the IMF. We must provide even more opportunities for Ukrainians in the coming year and guarantee the strength of our banking and financial systems., I also spoke with the head of the world's largest investment fund, BlackRock. I received another confirmation that the business of the developed world believes in our victory and is ready to invest in our reconstruction. Specialists of this company are already helping Ukraine to structure the Fund for the reconstruction of our state. And we are already preparing to participate in the World Economic Forum in Davos. The position and prospects of Ukraine will be presented there., In general, this week will be important for Ukraine from a political point of view. We are entering the next year and must retain a common understanding of our national goals. Of course, this is the liberation of our land from the enemy, as well as the restoration of Ukraine, the return of our people home, the further rapprochement of our state with key partners, the opening of new opportunities for Ukraine in the world - these are all tasks for the near future. And not only for the state, but also for each and every one of us. Soon I will present my view on the implementation of these tasks in the annual Message to the Verkhovna Rada on the external and internal situation of Ukraine., I want this Message to be not a report, but our conversation about the coming year., Thank you to everyone who works for Ukraine!, Thank you to everyone who fights for our independence!, Thank you to all the units of our defense forces, which bring the defeat of the enemy closer!, Glory to Ukraine!"
26 December 2022  - 22:11 ,"The situation in Donbas is difficult; I thank our guys who hold their positions firmly and find opportunities to ""subtract"" the occupiers - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, A brief report on today - another day of another week of our resistance., First. The frontline. Bakhmut, Kreminna and other areas in Donbas, which now require maximum strength and concentration., The situation there is difficult, acute. The occupiers are using all the resources available to them - and these are significant resources - to squeeze out at least some advance., And I thank all our guys who hold their positions firmly, stand strong, and who nevertheless find opportunities not only to not lose anything, but also to drive the occupiers out, to ""subtract"" them., Today I want to celebrate the 10th separate mountain assault brigade for capturing the occupiers in the Donetsk region. It is very important. This will enable us to release more Ukrainians., I will also celebrate the 80th and 95th separate airborne assault brigades for the successful destruction of the enemy force in the Lyman direction. Well done, guys! The more the occupiers lose, the more time we all gain for Ukraine., Second. Energy sector., I want to thank all the workers of the energy companies, all the repair crews for the fact that this Saturday and Sunday - on Christmas Eve and Christmas - it was possible to give people more energy., Of course, deficits remain. Shutdowns continue. As of this evening, about 9 million people are disconnected in various regions of Ukraine. But the number and duration of outages is still gradually decreasing. I am thankful to each and everyone who made this result possible., Today I held a special meeting with government officials regarding the situation in the energy and infrastructure spheres. We are preparing for the next year - and not only for the winter months. There are threats that we have to eliminate. There are steps that need to be taken. And the state will definitely take them., Third. Today I held an extended meeting on the results of the visit to the USA and the implementation of the agreements., We will not waste time. We will quickly implement everything that was agreed upon in Washington. As much as possible., And one more thing. Today I spoke with the Prime Minister of India. Next year, it will be India that will preside over the G20. I wished Mr. Modi a fruitful presidency, and fruitful not for someone in particular, but for everyone in the world who values peace., India can be more active in efforts to end aggression, so I hope we can do more together for global stability in the coming year., Thank you to everyone who works for Ukraine regardless of whether it's a holiday, a weekend, or a weekday! Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine!, Thank you to everyone who helps our country!, And please don't forget to be prepared for Russian missile attacks or provocations. Air defense is preparing, the state is preparing, and everyone must prepare. Please pay attention to the sirens., Glory to Ukraine!"
25 December 2022  - 20:50 ,The darkness will not prevent us from leading the occupiers to their new defeats - address by the President of Ukraine,", Ukrainians!, Today, millions of people celebrate Christmas according to the Gregorian calendar. And I once again congratulate everyone who is celebrating right now, these days., And I want us to once again express gratitude - together - to all those who both these days and at any other time are doing everything so that we can live. Live our life and in our country., I thank each of our warriors - all military personnel. All fighters of the Air Forces, anti-aircraft fighters, intelligence officers, border guards, national guardsmen, warriors of the territorial defense, Naval Forces. Thank you to every soldier and sailor, to every sergeant and sergeant-major, to every officer and general who are holding the front and trying to push it further - to our borders that we have to reach., Thanks to everyone who repairs and supplies equipment. To everyone who volunteers., Thanks to all our medics and everyone who saves the wounded on the battlefield. Thank you to all the nurses who perform their work selflessly under any circumstances., Thank you to everyone who helps provide hospitals with everything necessary. To all those who come to donate blood for the wounded... And to all those who came now in Kherson to help. To save the wounded from the attack of terrorists on Christmas... Artillery and mortars against ordinary streets of Kherson... Savages!, We will find every Russian murderer. And I thank everyone who works for this: all investigative teams, all prosecutors, officials and diplomats., Thank you to each and everyone who helps get Ukrainians out of captivity., Thank you to all our energy workers and repairmen, sappers, policemen, employees of the State Emergency Service, utility workers., Thank you to the educators who continue to build our future and the builders who take care of our present., Thank you to the transporters who keep our economy alive and the financiers who maintain our stability., Thank you to the IT specialists who chose Ukraine., Thank you to officials who care about people and businesses who help society to be resilient., Thank you to our farmers, thank you to the agrarians who did not give up last spring and are preparing for the next one., Thank you to all journalists who spread the truth and public figures who help our people to keep faith in themselves and in victory., Thank you to all the leaders and peoples of the world, who this year, together with Ukraine, became leaders in the defense of freedom and next year, I believe, together with us, will do everything to become leaders of peace. It's possible., Fellow Ukrainians!, There are only a few days left this year. We must be aware that our enemy will try to make this time dark and difficult for us. Russia lost everything it could this year. But it is trying to compensate for its losses with the gloating of its propagandists after the missile strikes at our country, at our energy sector., I know that the darkness will not prevent us from leading the occupiers to their new defeats. But we have to be ready for any scenario., Please pay attention to air alarms these days. Search again and remember where the nearest Point of Invincibility is located., Tell your parents how to find the Point of Invincibility if needed. More than 5,500 points have already been opened throughout the country., Please take care of yourself. And be ready to help others., When Ukrainians are together, when Ukrainians are grateful to each other, we cannot be defeated. May it always be so! And it will be so, I'm sure!, Glory to our strong, beautiful, best people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
24 December 2022  - 19:00 ,Christmas greetings of the President of Ukraine to Western Rite Orthodox Christians,", Dear people!, These days, millions of people in Ukraine and the world celebrate Christmas. The appearance of the Son of God gave people hope for salvation, faith in the victory of goodness and mercy., Unfortunately, all the holidays have a bitter aftertaste for us this year. And we can feel the traditional Spirit of Christmas differently. Dinner at the family table cannot be so tasty and warm. There may be empty chairs around it. And our houses and streets can't be so bright. And Christmas bells can ring not so loudly and inspiringly. Through air raid sirens, or even worse – gunshots and explosions. And all this together can pose a bigger threat. It is a disappointment. Of the higher forces and their power, of goodness and justice in the world. Loss of hope. Loss of love. Loss of myself..., But isn't this what evil and darkness, which have taken up arms against us, want in their essence?, We have been resisting them for more than three hundred days and eight years. And will we allow them to achieve what they want?, In this battle, we have another powerful and effective weapon. The hammer and sword of our spirit and consciousness. The wisdom of God. Courage and bravery. Virtues that incline us to do good and overcome evil., The main act of courage is endurance and completion of one's work to the end, despite everything. The truth illuminates our path. We know it. We defend it. Our truth is a struggle for freedom. Freedom comes at a high price. But slavery has an even higher price., Our path is illuminated by faith and patience. Patience and faith. These are twin forces. As it was said, ""he who rules and controls his own spirit, is better than he who captures a city."" To endure does not mean to accept the circumstances. Patience is watching to make sure that we don't let any doubt or fear into our minds. It is faith in one's own strength., Evil has no weapon stronger than the armor given to us by God. Evil smashes against this armor like a stone wall. We have seen this more than once. We endured at the beginning of the war. We endured attacks, threats, nuclear blackmail, terror, missile strikes. Let's endure this winter because we know what we are fighting for., We go forward through the thorns to the stars, knowing what awaits us at the end of the road. God is a just Judge who rewards good and punishes evil. Which side we are on is obvious. Who is who in this battle is obvious. There are at least seven proofs of this – they are known - ""A proud look, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood, An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, Feet that be swift in running to mischief, A false witness that speaketh lies, And he that soweth discord among brethren."" We oppose all this. Being a role model for others. The faithful, that is, those who really believe, must be a light to the rest of the world. For more than three hundred days, Ukrainians have been striving for this, proving it, serving as an example to others. We are not righteous, not holy, but we are definitely fighting for good and fighting for the light, with faith in Bible prophecy:, ""Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth. The people who walk in darkness will see a bright light. The light will shine on those who live in the land of death's shadow. For to us a child is born, to us a son is given!"", We believe that tears will be replaced by joy, hope will come after despair, and death will be defeated by life., Dear Ukrainian people!, Today and all future winter holidays we meet in difficult circumstances. Someone will see the first star in the sky over Bakhmut, Rubizhne, and Kreminna today. Along thousands of kilometers of the front line. Someone is on the road, on the way – from the Ukrainian-Polish border to Kherson region or Zaporizhzhia. Someone will see it through the bullet holes of his or her own home. Someone will celebrate the holiday in other people's homes, but strange people's homes – homes of Ukrainians who gave shelter to Ukrainians. In Zakarpattia, Bukovyna, Lviv region, Ivano-Frankivsk region and many other regions. Someone will hear Shchedryk in another language - in Warsaw, Berlin, London, New York, Toronto and many other cities and countries. And someone will meet this Christmas in captivity, but let them remember that we are also coming for our people, we will return freedom to all Ukrainian men and women., Wherever we are, we will be together today. And together we will look at the evening sky. And together we will remember the morning of February 24. Let's remember how much we have passed. Let's remember Azovstal, Irpin, Bucha, Kramatorsk, Snake Island, Chornobayivka, Izium, Kherson. We make a wish. One for all. And we will feel joy. One for all. And we will understand the truth. One for all. About the fact that no kamikaze drones are capable of extinguishing the Christmas Dawn. We will see its glow even underground in a bomb shelter. We will fill our hearts with warmth and light. No Kinzhal missile can hurt them. They will break against our steel spirit. And our struggle will continue without stopping. It is not threatened by planned or emergency blackouts. And we will never feel a shortage of courage and indomitability., We have experienced a lot of bitter news and will deservedly receive good news. We will sing Christmas carols – cheerier than ever – louder than the sound of a generator. We will hear the voices and greetings of relatives – in our hearts – even if communication service and the Internet are down. And even in total darkness – we will find each other – to hug each other tightly. And if there is no heat, we will give a big hug to warm each other., We will celebrate our holidays! As always. We will smile and be happy. As always. The difference is one. We will not wait for a miracle. After all, we create it ourselves., Christ is born! Let's praise Him!"
23 December 2022  - 19:42 ,"We see prospects at the front, we see terrorist state's intentions and we will respond – address of President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, I held a meeting of the Staff today. It was as always substantive, but today more news for the troops after a visit to the United States., We are preparing for the coming months and next year in general. Our tasks are unchanged. It is the liberation of our land. Safety for our people. Restoration of our country after the Russian strikes. These are the elements of the Ukrainian victory, which we are approaching step by step., We heard today the commanders' reports at the Staff meeting. We see prospects at the front. We are preparing for different variants of actions of the terrorist state, we see its intentions. And we will respond., The situation in the energy sector was discussed separately., Today I held an important annual meeting with the ambassadors of Ukraine – the entire diplomatic corps of our country received tasks for the next year., We are preparing to step up Ukrainian diplomacy in several directions., The first are the countries in which our influence is still less than we need from the point of view of the national security of Ukraine and the interests of our people. First of all, these are the countries of Africa and other parts of the Global South – Latin America, Asian countries, and the Pacific region., This is a huge economic potential, and it is also a significant diplomatic opportunity. For example, during the voting of the UN General Assembly for resolutions that protect our territorial integrity and international law. We will strengthen Ukraine's position., The second aspect of Ukrainian diplomacy is to increase cooperation with our traditional partners so that the next year will really be decisive in this war and Ukraine will achieve all its goals., We are preparing to upgrade the diplomatic service, we will strengthen the Ukrainian embassies., There was also a non-public part of our meeting with diplomats today – I focused on several important, sensitive points in communication with the ambassadors., I spoke today with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. I am grateful for the new support package – very important, timely EUR 2.5 billion for Ukraine. Of course, our joint actions with the Netherlands next year were also discussed. We are coordinating the steps as much as possible, and I believe that there will be a tangible result, especially in the matter of bringing to justice all those who are guilty of this aggression against Ukraine., And one more., It was an honor for me to congratulate those people who, together with their colleagues, are restoring our systems after the Russian strikes. I believe that all of us should thank more often those who work for the preservation of our well-being and normal life. Not political at all. Maybe not always visible to most. But thanks to many of these people, Ukraine is living., In particular, anyone and everyone who repairs the grids and generation facilities damaged by the strikes, before the air alert has even ended, to give people power faster, is the true hero. Everyone who goes to the de-occupied and front-line areas to return everything for normal life to people is the real hero. Everyone who stabilizes our power system every day and every night, ensures the supply of electricity, the operation of plants and other energy facilities – all of them, along with others who fight and work for Ukraine, guarantee Ukraine's future. Thank you for that!, I signed decrees on awarding our troops. 215 soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were given state awards., Glory to all who defend our state!, Thanks to all our partners who help us and together with us are securing victory over tyranny!, And please remember who is fighting against us. With the approaching holiday season, Russian terrorists may become active again. They despise Christian values and any values in general. Therefore, please heed the air raid signals, help each other and always take care of each other., And more. Citizens of Russia must clearly understand that terror never goes unanswered., Glory to Ukraine!"
23 December 2022  - 16:02 ,Every day you should feel that people's lives and the situation in our country depend on your work - President's speech at the Conference of Ambassadors of Ukraine,", We are already used to it. This means that everything is fine. If there are sirens, it means that Russia does not forget about us and is afraid of us. We will defeat everyone., Dmytro Ivanovych! Dear Mr. Minister!, Dear attendees!, Dear heads of diplomatic missions of our country!, 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, we all have to be with Ukraine. We have no right to a weekend, no right to rest, no right to vacation, no right to an eight-hour work day., All the rights guaranteed by the Constitution of Ukraine are currently on hold for us personally as representatives of our state. Because if we rest or take it lightly, if we are careless, we will have neither the Constitution of Ukraine nor our state., We must sleep less than the enemy, think more than the enemy, take risks more effectively than the enemy, and communicate with the world better, constantly, on a different level than anyone else in this world., Such an attitude should define your work. We must do everything possible and impossible, formally and informally, personally and directing the forces of the powerful, professional teams we have formed in order to strengthen the defense of our state, guarantee the safety of our people and accelerate the victory of Ukraine., Actually, these are the criteria by which I evaluate and will evaluate the effectiveness of each and every one of you, your work., We do not have time to, for example, watch the two-hour press conferences of the President of the Russian Federation. We simply do not have time for such trifles. We already know how this war will end, and therefore every hour of yours is very important, it should add up the strength of Ukraine and accelerate our victory., Ladies and Gentlemen!, Ukraine needs concrete results from each and every one of you. The results that will allow everyone who fights and works for our people, for the sake of Ukraine, to say that you stand by them, even though you are in other countries of the world., And for that to happen, you must understand how bravely and selflessly our people fight, how much they do so that the state can survive, and how much they sacrifice to preserve our free and independent life., No matter where you live and work abroad, you must still live in Ukraine and for Ukraine. No matter where you are on a working trip, you should still be with Ukraine and feel Ukrainians., The country is at war. You must be at war. Every day you should feel that the life of our state depends on your work, the lives of people and the situation on our land depend on it., Yesterday, as you know, we returned to Ukraine from the United States of America. And this was my first visit abroad after February 24 - to the key ally of our state, the United States., It was a fruitful visit. We have a decision on strengthening our air defense. The Congress is working on a powerful financial package for Ukraine and global security - 45 billion US dollars. We have significant strategic agreements with the United States for the coming months, which will definitely strengthen the capabilities of the most important thing - our defense forces in key directions., I urge you to consider this visit as a very important reference point, as a set bar. I don't have the opportunity of foreign visits - I just don’t, there's no time. As it was done before, in different conditions. I have opportunities to do this kind of work in other formats - and you know it, you've seen it. I think it was quite effective this year., But if any visit potentially has as significant, important, strategic content as my visit to the United States, if our Armed Forces, all our defense forces absolutely directly depend on the results of the visit, if one or another partner of ours is ready to take the lead in the implementation of the points of the Ukrainian Peace Formula, if there can be decisive steps to accelerate our victory, there can be my negotiations on a personal level as an exception to the general practice of wartime., You have to know what result you will potentially give in your direction. Fight for Ukraine, for strategic results for Ukraine!, The second aspect: we must constantly create new opportunities for our state., This year we achieved historic results. It’s true., We have achieved and are increasing vital military, financial, sanction, humanitarian and other necessary support for Ukraine. Despite Russia's all-out war against us, against each and every one, we preserved the resilience of our state., A powerful global coalition has been created around Ukraine and the protection of international security, which unites not only traditional partners, but also – what is very important – states with which relations are just being built., Ukraine united the European Union in an unprecedented way and gained the status of a candidate for joining the EU. This is a great achievement. We applied for NATO membership., Historically significant results have been achieved in our cooperation with the UN and at the UN site. This applies both to Ukrainian export initiatives and to the decisions adopted for the sake of Ukraine, in particular the resolutions of the UN General Assembly., 143 countries of the world – more than ever before – supported our territorial integrity and condemned Russian aggression., Our grain export initiative enables the world to overcome the severity of the food crisis. More than 14 million tons of agricultural products were exported - you know - to more than forty countries of the world. We also launched the Grain from Ukraine humanitarian initiative., Both initiatives put our state in the same line with those who really guarantee global security for the whole world. And next year, we will increase this, I believe, very important activity of ours., Special attention is paid to those regions and continents where our interests are so far represented less than we need for the good of Ukraine and our protection against Russian aggression. In particular, this is Africa., We are already restarting relations with dozens of African countries. We have to step it up next year., Ten countries have already been determined where new embassies of Ukraine in Africa will be opened. We also developed the concept of the ""Ukraine - Africa"" trading house with the opening of its offices in the capitals of the most promising countries of the African continent. In addition to the existing representation of Ukraine in ten African countries - along with new embassies and trading houses - we must achieve representation in thirty countries of the African continent., Global growth and international stability in this century cannot be imagined without relations with Africa and other parts of the Global South: Latin America, India, other Asian countries, including China and Southeast Asia, the entire region of the islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Ukraine must find the format of its leadership in strategic processes in each of these regions, and the role of the diplomatic corps of Ukraine will be decisive., We need passports for Ukraine's relations with each country, as it is currently done by us with African countries. I think the ministers, my colleagues, diplomatic institutions will explain this to you in more detail. We need clarity and defined intersection of our interests with partners and potential partners., It is necessary to bring the capacity of Ukraine to a new level in the foreign policy of emergency situations. We need such a tool that will enable our state to respond to crisis situations in the world. Our presence should be felt by absolutely everyone, everyone should be interested in our help. To this end, we are preparing the creation of the Ukrainian International Aid Agency, which will expand the geography of our influence and form additional lines of cooperation with partners., As we ensure the sustainability of our country together with our partners, we can also help other countries maintain and develop sustainability., As an example, we can consider our cooperation with partners in the field of food security, in the field of digitization and - which is very important, where we have really important developments - in cyber defense. We have experience that can strengthen our partners and give Ukraine new friends in the world., Of course, all this requires updating the regulations and ensuring the work of our diplomats., To this end, I commission the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to prepare an ambitious draft of amendments to the Law of Ukraine on the Diplomatic Service., The system of work of embassies must be updated. In order for embassies to be able to work truly as a team, the approach to the formation of the embassy team must be changed. The ambassador is responsible for the result, and therefore the ambassador needs to influence the formation of the embassy team. It will be done., Of course, injustice in financing the work of our representative offices, in particular in Africa, will also be corrected., The third aspect: the world should know about the needs of Ukraine and the needs of our people. Not only politicians, but also business, the very important media environment, and the civil sector., This is critically necessary for the reconstruction of Ukraine, for the restoration and development of the social and investment opportunities of our state, as well as for the pressure on Russia for this shameful war, for terror, to constantly increase., Our embassies and our state should be heard and seen in the countries of your direct work., In particular, one of your tasks, in addition to the general task of popularizing Ukraine, should be the organization of visits of those who can actually become and are newsmakers in the country of your stay., Take a look at examples of what has been done this year. Just a few examples, there were many of them, but still... For example, the Crimea Platform summit of the parliamentary dimension in Croatia - it was done jointly by the teams of Ruslan Stefanchuk, the government, the Office, all our diplomats. The conference on strengthening our energy sector and infrastructure in general, which took place in France and where Ukraine was represented by Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, Yulia Svyrydenko and Rostyslav Shurma. Agreements were reached in the amount of about 2 billion euros. The visit of the First Lady of Ukraine to Washington, her speech in Congress, meetings after which the possibility of a powerful strengthening of air defense opened up for Ukraine. A very important visit. Agreements regarding grain, which were dealt with by the team of Oleksandr Kubrakov and the team of the Office. The release of our prisoners of war, in particular the defenders of Mariupol and Azovstal, which was ensured by the team led by Andriy Yermak, Kyrylo Budanov and Rustem Umyerov, which is extremely important. The activity, which was aimed at obtaining candidate status, historical candidate status, and the corresponding visits and negotiations of Dmytro Kuleba, Olha Stefanishyna, Andriy Sybiha, Ihor Zhovkva, Emine Dzhaparova, Oleksiy Chernyshov - this entire team., We need this level of events for Ukraine next year. We need to create events that could talk about Ukraine and our interests. Political events of strategic importance. You should focus on this and ensure at least one such event per month for the sake of Ukraine., Ladies and Gentlemen!, Today, several special, very important areas of work in the coming year will be presented to you., In particular, the Head of my Office will present what can be done to implement the Ukrainian Peace Formula. I want to emphasize: this is a practical thing. Not some kind of abstraction, not some trick, not a rhetorical tool. This is a specific task, points that must be implemented in order to restore the territorial integrity of our state and guarantee the security of Ukraine and Ukrainians., There are more specific tasks for us for the next year. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to outline some of them, those we need to implement to make the next year a truly victorious year for all of us. So., Start of negotiations on Ukraine's accession to the EU., Preparation for the planned NATO summit and ensuring concrete results of this summit for Ukraine, which we all know about., Each of you will be presented with our updated defense and security needs for our army. You must constantly work to satisfy them., Ukrainian energy sector and, in general, the needs of our country for recovery after the Russian strikes, Fast Recovery Plan - please work as closely as possible with the government, the Office, international organizations and partner states, so that all these existing agreements are provided with a concrete content and result., Sanctions against Russia. We have to ensure new strong sanction packages next year. The terrorist state must feel real pressure, and your actions - the actions of our diplomatic corps - must be aimed at this., The Tribunal for the crime of aggression and the accountability of war criminals - work to ensure that the countries of your stay support us., Help find and block Russia’s assets linked not only to government officials, but also to Russian businesses that support the war. All these funds will be directed to the restoration of Ukraine. Do everything you can to ensure that the countries in which you work help build an effective compensation mechanism., And be sure to support our people not just as much as you can, but much more. They are facing extremely hard times. Work for our people to return to the state and for all their rights and legitimate interests in the host countries are satisfied. Ukrainian identity, Ukrainian cultural, educational, information and social needs must be satisfied., In everything, take as an example our work on ""Patriots"", ""NASAMS"", ""IRIS-T"", ""Crotale"". We were told that it was impossible. That all this was impossible. Now it's all there. Diplomacy is just such a tool. Everything that faces a ""no"" at the beginning must become a concrete result for all of us., The implementation of all the tasks I mentioned today is not only a specific work plan for the next year., We must understand: this is our victory, these are the elements of this victory. When we implement a specific task, we accelerate victory for Ukraine, accelerate victory for our people., The most important task for all of us is victory in this war. We must, and we will get it!, Glory to all our warriors! Gratitude to everyone who works for our victory!, Thank you for all your work for our state in a particularly difficult time after February 24!, I sincerely congratulate you on your day, your professional day - the Day of Diplomatic Service Employees - and I wish you all to achieve even more results in the coming year than this year., I wish you all a Merry Christmas, happy holidays, and a Happy New Year. May this year be victorious!, Glory to Ukraine!"
22 December 2022  - 18:06 ,"When we say ""patriots"" in Ukraine and in the United States, we equally mean the protection of the state and people - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today will be a very short address and in unusual conditions, but as always - about what we have achieved., We are returning from Washington - we are coming with good results. With something that will really help., When we say ""patriots"" in Ukraine and in the United States, we equally mean the protection of the state and people. This issue has been settled for Ukraine. There is financial support too., Also there are other agreements - more on that later., I thank President Biden for his help, his international leadership, and his determination to win., I am grateful to the Congress of the United States - both houses, both parties, all those who support Ukraine, all those who want victory as much as we all do. There will be victory!, Glory to each of our warriors! Glory to everyone who defends our state! We are bringing to Ukraine, to Donbas, to Bakhmut and to the south the decisions that our Defense Forces have been waiting for., On the way home, I met with President of Poland Andrzej Duda. I thanked him, all Poles, the city - rescuer Rzeszów for everything they do for Ukraine and our protection - the protection of Europe., Today, in a special format, face to face, we discussed our interaction with Andrzej. I told him about what I heard in the United States, about our strategic vision for the next year... We are preparing, strengthening our joint forces., And one more thing - today is a professional holiday of people who give us normality, modernity and exactly the level of well-being that the terrorist state wants to destroy. Today is the Day of Energy Workers. I congratulate all of you, defenders of the Ukrainian light, and thank you for your work. We also bring new agreements to help you!, Glory to Ukraine!"
22 December 2022  - 07:39 ,"We stand, we fight and we will win. Because we are united. Ukraine, America and the entire free world - address by Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a joint meeting of the US Congress",", Dear Americans!, In all states, cities and communities. All those who value freedom and justice. Who cherish it as strongly, as we, Ukrainians, in all our cities, in each and every family. I hope my words of respect and gratitude resonate in each American heart!, Madam Vice President, I thank you for your efforts in helping Ukraine! Madam Speaker, you bravely visited Ukraine during the full-fledged war, thank you very much! It is a great honor, a great privilege to be here!, Dear members of the Congress – representatives of both parties – who also visited Kyiv! Esteemed Congressmen and Senators – from both parties – who will visit Ukraine, I’m sure, in the future! Dear representatives of diaspora – present in this chamber and spread across the country! Dear journalists!, It's a great honor for me to be at the U.S. Congress and speak to you and all Americans!, Against all odds and doom and gloom scenarios, Ukraine did not fall. Ukraine is alive and kicking., And it gives me good reason to share with you our first joint victory – we defeated Russia in the battle for minds of the world. We have no fear. Nor should anyone in the world have it., Ukrainians gained this victory – and it gives us courage, which inspires the entire world., Americans gained this victory – and that's why you have succeeded in uniting the global community to protect freedom and international law., Europeans gained this victory – and that's why Europe is now stronger and more independent than ever., The Russian tyranny has lost control over us and it will never influence our minds again., Yet, we have to do whatever it takes to ensure that countries of the Global South also gain such victory., I know one more thing – the Russians will stand a chance to be free only when they defeat the Kremlin in their minds., Yet, the battle continues! And we have to defeat the Kremlin on the battlefield., This battle is not only for the territory – for this or another part of Europe. This battle is not only for life, freedom and security of Ukrainians or any other nation, which Russia attempts to conquer. This struggle will define – in what world our children and grandchildren will live and then – their children and grandchildren. It will define whether it will be a democracy – for Ukrainians and for Americans – for all., This battle cannot be frozen or postponed. It cannot be ignored hoping that the ocean or something else will provide a protection., From the United States to China, from Europe to Latin America, and from Africa to Australia – the world is too interconnected and interdependent to allow someone to stay aside – and at the same time – to feel safe when such a battle continues., Our two nations are Allies in this battle., And next year will be a turning point. The point, when Ukrainian courage and American resolve must guarantee the future of our common freedom. The freedom of people, who stand for their values., Ladies and Gentlemen!, Americans!, Yesterday – before coming here to Washington DC – I was at the frontline, in our Bakhmut. In our stronghold in the East of Ukraine – in the Donbas., The Russian military and mercenaries have been attacking Bakhmut non-stop since May. They have been attacking it day and night. But Bakhmut stands., Last year seventy thousand people lived there in Bakhmut and now only few civilians stay., Every inch of that land is soaked in blood. Roaring guns sound every hour. Trenches in the Donbas change hands several times a day in fierce combat and even hand fighting. But the Ukrainian Donbas stands., Russians use everything they have against Bakhmut and our other beautiful cities., The occupiers have a significant advantage in artillery. They have an advantage in ammunition. They have much more missiles and planes than we ever had., But our Defense Forces stand. And we all are proud of them., The Russian tactic is primitive. They burn down and destroy everything they see. They sent thugs to the frontlines. They sent convicts to the war..., They threw everything against us – similar to the other tyranny, which in the Battle of the Bulge threw everything it had against the free world. Just like the brave American soldiers, which held their lines and fought back Hitler’s forces during the Christmas of 1944, brave Ukrainian soldiers are doing the same to Putin’s forces this Christmas. Ukraine holds its lines and will never surrender!, So, here is the frontline – the tyranny, which has no lack of cruelty – against the lives of free people., And your support is crucial – not just to stand in such fights, but to get to the turning point. To win on the battlefield., We have artillery. Yes. Thank you. Is it enough? Honestly, not really. To ensure Bakhmut is not just a stronghold that holds back the Russian army – but for the Russian army to completely pull out – more cannons and shells are needed., If so, just like the battle of Saratoga, the fight for Bakhmut will change the trajectory of our war for independence and freedom., If your «Patriots» stop the Russian terror against our cities, it will let Ukrainian patriots work to the full to defend our freedom., When Russia cannot reach our cities by its artillery, it tries to destroy them with missile attacks. More than that, Russia found an Ally in its genocidal policy – Iran., Iranian deadly drones, sent to Russia in hundreds, became a threat to our critical infrastructure. That is how one terrorist has found the other. It is just a matter of time – when they will strike against your other allies, if we do not stop them now. We must do it!, I believe there should be no taboos between us in our alliance. Ukraine never asked the American soldiers to fight on our land instead of us. I assure you that Ukrainian soldiers can perfectly operate American tanks and planes themselves., Financial assistance is also critically important. And I would like to thank you for both, financial packages you have already provided us with, and the ones you may be willing to decide on. Your money is not charity. It's an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way. , Russia could stop its aggression if it wanted to, but you can speed up our victory. I know it., And it will prove to any potential aggressor that no one can succeed in breaking national borders, committing atrocities and reigning over people against their will., It would be naive to wait for steps towards peace from Russia – which enjoys being a terrorist state. Russians are still poisoned by the Kremlin., The restoration of international legal order is our joint task. We need peace. Ukraine has already offered proposals, which I just discussed with President Biden – our Peace Formula., Ten points, which should and must be implemented for our joint security – guaranteed for decades ahead., And the Summit, which can be held., I am glad to stress that President Biden supported our peace initiative today. Each of you, ladies and gentlemen, can assist in its implementation – to ensure that America’s leadership remains solid, bicameral and bipartisan., You can strengthen sanctions to make Russia feel how ruinous its aggression truly is., It is in your power to help us bring to justice everyone, who started this unprovoked and criminal war. Let's do it!, Let the terrorist state be held responsible for its terror and aggression, and compensate all losses done by this war., Let the world see that the United States is here!, Ladies and Gentlemen!, Americans!, In two days, we will celebrate Christmas. Maybe, candlelit. Not because it is more romantic. But because there will be no electricity. Millions won't have neither heating nor running water. All of this will be the result of Russian missile and drone attacks on our energy infrastructure. But we do not complain., We do not judge and compare whose life is easier., Your well-being is the product of your national security – the result of your struggle for independence and your many victories., We, Ukrainians, will also go through our war of independence and freedom with dignity and success., We'll celebrate Christmas – and even if there is no electricity, the light of our faith in ourselves will not be put out. If Russian missiles attack us – we'll do our best to protect ourselves. If they attack us with Iranian drones and our people will have to go to bomb shelters on Christmas eve – Ukrainians will still sit down at a holiday table and cheer up each other. And we don't have to know everyone's wish as we know that all of us, millions of Ukrainians, wish the same – victory. Only victory., We already built strong Ukraine – with strong people, strong army, and strong institutions. Together with you!, We develop strong security guarantees for our country and for entire Europe and the world. Together with you!, And also – together with you! – we’ll put in place everyone, who will defy freedom., This will be the basis to protect democracy in Europe and the world over., Now, on this special Christmas time, I want to thank you. All of you. I thank every American family, which cherishes the warmth of its home and wishes the same warmth to other people., I thank President Biden and both parties at the Senate and the House – for your invaluable assistance., I thank your cities and your citizens, who supported Ukraine this year, who hosted our people, who waved our national flags, who acted to help us., Thank you all! From everyone, who is now at the frontline. From everyone, who is awaiting victory. , Standing here today, I recall the words of the President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which are so good for this moment: ""The American People in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory""., The Ukrainian People will win, too. Absolutely. I know that everything depends on us. On Ukrainian Armed Forces! Yet, so much depends on the world! So much in the world depends on you!, When I was in Bakhmut yesterday, our heroes gave me the flag. The battle flag. The flag of those who defend Ukraine, Europe and the world at the cost of their lives. They asked me to bring this flag to the US Congress – to members of the House of Representatives and Senators, whose decisions can save millions of people., So, let these decisions be taken!, Let this flag stay with you, ladies and gentlemen!, This flag is a symbol of our victory in this war!, We stand, we fight and we will win. Because we are united. Ukraine, America and the entire free world., May God protect our brave troops and citizens! May God forever bless the United States of America!, Merry Christmas and a happy victorious new year!, Слава Україні!"
20 December 2022  - 21:27 ,Support our indomitable Bakhmut and its defenders - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, I’ve returned from the Donetsk region, from our Bakhmut fortress. I was there today to support our fighters, to present state awards, to express gratitude to them. To all our heroes - those who defend not only Bakhmut there, and not only our Donbas, but also the whole of Ukraine. We all should understand this., You know, on the way to the frontline, today I also passed through Slovyansk, Kramatorsk, Druzhkivka, Kostiantynivka... Cities, villages near them, which are now literally fighting for life. Life for all of us - for all Ukrainians and for everything Ukrainian, and even more so - for everything and everyone who preserves humanity inside., Look at Russia's offensive, what it leaves where it takes its flag. Burned earth, destroyed life... Pain, ruins and graves - this is the so-called ""Russian world"". This is what our heroes stop., This is exactly what they are expelling from Ukraine, step by step returning life to our land, where the occupiers set foot. And for this movement to exist, for our border to exist, for us to return the Ukrainian flag to the cities and villages in the south and east of our state, there is Bakhmut, there is a fortress, there are our heroic defenders., Every day they endured there, every hit they withstood there, every attack they repelled and every counterattack they carried out is a life for Ukraine., I thank all our warriors who defend the #bakhmutfortress! I am grateful to all mothers and fathers, wives and children of our heroes who are saving Ukraine right there! And I am asking all our people: wherever you are, please support the Ukrainian heroes who are holding out against the fiercest attacks of the occupiers, against the most insane Russian strikes..., Support our Bakhmut - tattered yet unconquered - and his defenders., We will do everything possible and impossible, expected and unexpected, so that our heroes have everything they need to prevail. To get the results that all Ukrainians expect. That all our cities and villages on the frontline are waiting for. This is Maryinka, this is Vuhledar, this is Toretsk, this is Soledar, Klishchiivka... This is our Luhansk region, this is our south of Ukraine, this is our Crimea. Ukraine will leave nothing of its own to the enemy., This week is extremely important for Ukraine - in order to get through this winter and next year. In order to gain the necessary support and for the Ukrainian flag to finally prevail on all sections of our border - the border of Ukraine., Our fighters gave me our flag today and asked to pass it on to those whose decisions are very important for Ukraine, for all our warriors. We will definitely do it. We will definitely endure. We will definitely get the necessary support for Ukraine!, Glory to all the guards of the Bakhmut fortress! Glory to all who fight for our country!, Glory to our indomitable and beautiful people!, And eternal memory and honor to all Ukrainians whose lives were taken by this cruel war!, Glory to Ukraine!"
19 December 2022  - 23:45 ,The key task for all of us now is to increase international support for Ukraine next year - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today's morning in several regions and cities of our country was, unfortunately, spoiled by the characteristic sound of the Iranian Shaheds. But most of them luckily fell short of their intended targets, and that made our morning a little better today. 30 Shaheds were shot down - not bad, I thank all our anti-aircraft fighters, pilots, and mobile fire groups for this result and for the protection of the Ukrainian sky. And I am especially grateful to the 96th Kyiv and 208th Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigades, which showed the greatest accuracy today., These Shaheds, which were used by Russia, are from a new batch of drones. This is the terrorist international of two regimes - they help fight against people., Well, both of them will be held to account for it., This week will be quite active for us in terms of international events and negotiations. I held several meetings today regarding these plans. We will fight to strengthen sanctions for all manifestations of terror against Ukrainians and to get additional support for our state and our defense forces., Today I addressed the leaders of the ten states of Northern Europe united in The Joint Expeditionary Force. This is a format of cooperation initiated by Great Britain. It includes the Baltic states, Finland, Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, Iceland and the United Kingdom itself. And my appeal today was very specific. Weapons, ammunition, new defense capabilities... Everything that will allow us to speed up the end of this war. Thank you to the participants of the summit for the fact that we were heard today - we are waiting for new decisions regarding the supply of new weapons., The key task for all of us now – my task, and that of each of our diplomats and officials – is that world support for Ukraine next year not just remains at the same level as this year, but increases. Precisely under those indicators that are necessary to strengthen our defense operations., This is artillery - we need more guns, shells, these are modern tanks that have not yet been delivered to Ukraine, these are longer-range MLRS, modern and truly effective air defense..., Please, if your opinion is heard in the media, if you support the state in the expert field, you too can help get everything that our defense forces need., The main thing is to speak for Ukraine with one voice and defend our common interest: everything for the victory of Ukraine, everything to help our defense., Bakhmut is the hottest spot on the entire frontline - more than 1300 km of active hostilities. Since May, the occupiers have been trying to break our Bakhmut, but time goes by and Bakhmut is already breaking not only the Russian army, but also the Russian mercenaries who came to replace the wasted army of the occupiers., Just think about it: Russia has already lost almost 99 thousand of its soldiers in Ukraine. Soon there will be 100 thousand of the occupiers’ casualties. For what? No one in Moscow can answer this question. And they won't., They wage war and waste people's lives, other people's lives, not of their loved ones, not their own lives, but the lives of others only because a group in the Kremlin can’t admit mistakes and is terribly afraid of reality. But reality speaks for itself., I thank all our fighters who are heroically holding the Bakhmut direction, Soledar, Avdiivka, Maryinka, Kreminna direction and the entire Donbas region, which was one of the strongest in Ukraine before Russia came, and which Russia is destroying to the scorched ground. Even such cruelty won’t give the enemy anything., Today more consumers than yesterday are disconnected from electricity. Due to several drone hits in the morning., But repairmen, as always, work very actively, around the clock. They are trying to restore power supply as soon as possible, at least at the level that generation can provide. It will be done., And one more thing, which is especially important., Today is Saint Nicholas Day - a traditional day when we all wish peace and warmth, reliable protection and victory., I believe that Nicholas will hear us., Today - just on Saint Nicholas Day - the project by Ukrzaliznytsia and UNICEF started - a joint project that can bring a holiday to Ukrainian children. To those who live near the frontline and in the de-occupied areas. Special festive trains in three directions. Today - Donetsk region. On December 21, such a festive train leaves for the Kharkiv region. On the 23rd – Mykolaiv and Kherson regions. They bring festive performances and more than 30 thousand gifts., Thank you to everyone at Ukrzaliznytsia, UNICEF and the government who organized this project., I would also like to thank UNICEF separately for more than 100 million dollars of support for Ukrainian families. More than 120,000 families, in particular those raising four or more children, children with disabilities, can receive financial assistance., In total, the program will cover more than 600,000 Ukrainians. Thank you for such support!, Thank you to all those who help our people in this terrible time! Thank you to everyone who protects Ukrainians!, And I want to turn now to all our friends and just conscientious people in Georgia., Probably, everyone could see the health condition of Mikheil Saakashvili now. Therefore, I appeal to the people of Georgia, to the authorities of Georgia - it is necessary to show mercy, especially on the eve of Christmas. What is happening to Mykhailo now is cruelty. This does not suit Georgia. This must be stopped., Please make a decision that can save his life. Transfer Mikheil Saakashvili to one of the clinics of Ukraine, another European country, America., It is high time to take this good step., Glory to Ukraine!"
19 December 2022  - 14:25 ,Russian aggression can and must fail; our task is to speed it up - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the meeting of the leaders of the United Kingdom's Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF),", Thank you very much, Rishi, Mr. Prime Minister Sunak!, Mr. Prime Minister Kariņš, everyone present!, I am grateful, first of all, for these words of support. They are very important, and they are about the priorities you’ve mentioned., Dear friends, dear leaders!, First of all, I want to thank you all for supporting Ukraine and our struggle for freedom. When I participated in this format of ours last time, and it was on the twentieth day of a full-scale invasion, I called on you: help Ukraine and through it - help yourself. This is exactly how we have been acting all these months. And I thank you all for that, for your great support!, That is why we see the most important thing - that Russian aggression can and must fail. And our task now is to speed it up. Now - at this summit - I urge you to do everything to speed up the defeat of the occupiers., I will be very specific today - absolutely practical. Perhaps you expect a more political speech. But it is a different time now., It is time for specific things., Ukraine was again attacked by Iranian drones this night. 34 ""Shaheds"". I say both the number and the name, and quite specifically., These are ""Shaheds"" from the new batch that Russia received from Iran. 250 items - that's how many ""Shaheds"" have now been received by the terrorist state., Russian missiles and Iranian drones are constantly used to strike primarily at our energy sector - and you know all the details about it., Only one recent massive attack on Ukraine affected more than 20 million of our people. As a result, cities with millions of inhabitants and most Ukrainian regions were left completely without electricity. In general, on the evening of December 16, 22 million 408 thousand Ukrainians were disconnected from the energy supply. More than 10 million people had their water and heat supplies cut off. Imagine the scale of this terror., And imagine that it can be stopped., Dear leaders!, Right now to a large extent it depends on you when and how this war will end. And everything is very specific. The more successful our Defense Forces are, the sooner Russian aggression will fail., Winter is now a really crucial time., It is a time when decisions can be made, the results of which in the spring will allow us to outline the restoration of our territorial integrity and guarantee that Russian revanchism will never again cross the border of Ukraine, and therefore - the border of Europe. And I want to address everyone., Mr. Prime Minister of Britain! Rishi!, When we can fully protect the Ukrainian sky, it will mean the dismantling of the last great Russian opportunity to terrorize Ukraine., And therefore, it will also be the dismantling of the last great Russian hope that they will allegedly succeed in conquering our state and people., And I am asking you to increase the possibility of supplying air defense systems to our state and help speed up the relevant decisions of partners., One hundred percent air shield for Ukraine will be one of the most successful steps against Russian aggression. And this step is needed right now., Mr. Prime Minister of Norway! Mr. Støre!, I am asking you to continue your policy of defense support for Ukraine in the next year as well - at least at the same level as this year., And we already see tangible results., NASAMS which have already been given to us, significantly strengthened our defense. I thank you for this!, I am asking you to increase the supply of such systems and missiles for them., Mrs. Minister of Defense of the Netherlands! Mrs. Ollongren!, For our defense operations to be more successful, we need modern armored vehicles., First of all, tanks., There is no explanation why Ukraine has not yet obtained a decision on the provision of modern and effective tanks - in particular, ""Leopards"". This is vital! I am asking you and your partners to reach this decision, to help us., The first to open this defense opportunity for Ukraine - with the supply of tanks - will open it for all other partners of ours. The first step is needed to get others to take their steps as well., I am asking to continue our cooperation regarding Soviet-type tanks - the necessary shells, as well as Harpoon complexes and other artillery systems., Mr. Prime Minister of Sweden! Mr. Kristersson!, We have already discussed with you the possibilities of strengthening our artillery., This is what determines the developments on the battlefield, namely the artillery., You know how large a stockpile of artillery systems and shells there is in Russia., And this artillery arrogance of the terrorist state must be shut down. We need to increase our capabilities on the battlefield so that the Russian leadership quicklier understands that this aggression has no chance., You have good Archer systems - I urge you to make a decision on them., And also you can strengthen the capabilities in the defense of the sky, and if you can - these are RBS-98 anti-aircraft missile systems and these are Gripen aircraft. We have to achieve such a historically important result for us., Mr. President of Lithuania! Gіtanas, my friend!, I thank you for the fact that Lithuania became one of the first countries to help us., Even before the start of the full-scale invasion, when we have already been preparing for defense, you helped us., I thank you for that!, And I am asking you to continue our cooperation next year., We need both NASAMS, as you know, and ""Stingers"", which we can get if your decision is made., Dear Mr. Prime Minister of Latvia! Mr. Kariņš!, I thank you for your constant and principled support throughout the Russian war. And let's reduce the time of this aggression even more actively!, You can help us with artillery systems - please make such decisions., Dear Mrs. Prime Minister of Estonia! Mrs. Kallas!, You also have this opportunity - 155-mm artillery shells, spare parts for howitzers. Let's intensify our cooperation., Dear Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defense of Denmark! Mr. Ellemann-Jensen!, You are aware of our need for CAESAR systems, which have proven themselves well on the battlefield, and these are the systems you expect from France. But they are vitally necessary for us right now, precisely in Ukraine. We need your decision on CAESAR., And I am asking you to continue our cooperation next year, which has already been achieved in the field of defense, in particular in anti-ship defense., Dear Mr. President of Finland! Mr. Niinistö!, I thank you for the armored vehicles provided to us - the APCs that you provided help us a lot., You have 122-mm and 152-mm caliber - they are vitally necessary. Means of radio-electronic warfare, countering drones. MLRS complexes., Please maintain the level of interaction that has already been achieved between us., The sooner we restore our border, the stronger your security will be. I am sure of it., Dear Mrs. Prime Minister! Mrs. Jakobsdóttir!, I thank you for your demining initiatives and humanitarian leadership., I am asking you to expand our cooperation next year, to create even more opportunities to protect our people from Russian mine terror., Dear friends!, Today - on St. Nicholas Day according to the Eastern Rite - Russian terrorists ""gifted"" new strikes to Ukrainian children., I am asking you to support our country right now with a clear decision - to provide everything that can not only preserve the existing dynamics on the battlefield in Ukraine, but also accelerate the movement of our Defense Forces to victory. Because our victory will be the victory of each of you, it is the victory of Europe, your nations, the victory, which the whole world expects, I am sure of that., That’s that - Ukrainian children in their letters to St. Nicholas ask for air defense, weapons and victory - victory for themselves, victory for all Ukrainians. Our children understand everything., Let's act!, I thank you for your attention!, I thank you all for your support!, Glory to Ukraine!"
18 December 2022  - 22:23 ,"This winter, we are preparing a special summit for the sake of peace and invite our partners to show their leadership - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, I held a meeting of the Staff today. The situation in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions was examined in great detail. The Bakhmut direction is key., We keep the city, although the occupiers are doing everything so that not a single undamaged wall remains there., The Zaporizhzhia region, the Kherson region, the south in general - we are gradually reducing the potential of the occupiers. Minus ammunition dumps, minus logistics of the Russian army., Air defense is a constant priority of the Staff, and I emphasize this once again..., Dear partners! By helping us fully protect our skies, by providing us with more modern air defense systems in sufficient numbers, you can deprive the terrorist state of its main instrument of terror. This will be one of the most powerful steps that will bring the end of aggression closer. Russia will have to follow the path of cessation of aggression, when it can no longer follow the path of missile strikes., The border was also discussed in detail at the Staff. Protection of the border with both Russia and Belarus is also a constant priority. We are preparing for all possible defense scenarios. Whoever inclines Minsk to whatever, it will not help them just as any other sick idea in this war against Ukraine and Ukrainians., There are new results in returning light and heat to our people., Another 3 million Ukrainians have had their energy supply restored. Plus 6 million yesterday. That is, after the terrorist attack on Friday, there is already a result for 9 million of our people. In most cities, the work of transport is being normalized., I thank everyone who carries out these repair works in any weather and around the clock! I thank each of our partners who help us with equipment! I also thank Ukrainian business - everyone who transforms their shops, cafes, enterprises into new Points of Invincibility., Today, the FIFA World Cup final took place in Qatar - an emotional final., This is the meaning of football: everyone has a chance to win, everyone can show that he is the strongest. But the competition is on the playing field, not on the battlefield. And the worst thing that can happen is a red card, not a red button. When people are united by football, people are united by peace. That is why I have prepared a special address from Ukraine to the whole world for today. To all who value peace and life., Although FIFA blocked this address from being shown at the stadium before the final game in Qatar, the world still heard our call., Our football players shared the video... Yarmolenko and the entire national team of Ukraine, Shevchenko, Shovkovskyi, Modrić, Srna, Guardiola, Raț and many, many other wonderful players. I thank everyone! Partner states supported it. Thousands of world media spread it., We are already preparing a special summit this winter. A summit for peace. For our country and for any other nation that can be subjected to the same aggression, the same terror as Russia has brought to our land., The Ukrainian Peace Formula consists of ten clear points capable of creating a new, globally important security architecture, which will restore freedom to our entire Ukrainian land, to all our people. And which will serve as guarantees of freedom and security for other nations. Not if, but when it works for Ukrainians., And that is why we invite our partners to show their leadership in guaranteeing peace in the same way that the leadership of various countries and various statesmen is currently being shown in the defense of freedom. We fight together for Ukraine, for the values that unite Europe and the democratic world, for the global value of life. For everything that Russia is trying to destroy., It is not easy, it is difficult, but I am sure: we will pull through together, and Russia's aggression will fail. And in a way so that all other potential aggressors of the world do not dare to repeat what russism does., Glory to each of our warriors! Gratitude to everyone who works for the victory and who helps! We will pull through everything, we will overcome everything., And one more thing., Congratulations to the Jewish community of Ukraine and all the Jews of the world on Hanukkah. Those who were outnumbered defeated those who outnumbered them. Light defeated darkness. It will be the same this time. Chag Hanukkah Sameach!, Glory to Ukraine!"
17 December 2022  - 21:05 ,"Reliable air defense shield will make Russian missile terror impossible, this will mean security for millions of people – address of the President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians! I wish you health!, The main thing today is energy. During the day, it was possible to restore the electricity supply to almost 6 million Ukrainians. Repair work is ongoing now and has been going on non-stop since yesterday's terrorist attack., Of course, there is still a lot of work to do to stabilize the system. Problems with the supply of heat, big problems with the supply of water exist. The most difficult situation is in the city of Kyiv and the region, Vinnytsia and the region, Lviv and the region. But there are, unfortunately, large-scale outages in many other regions: they include Dnipro and Dnipropetrovsk region, Volyn, Zhytomyr region, Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk region, the city of Odesa and the region, Poltava region, Ternopil region, Chernihiv region and other cities and regions., Russia spares no resources for the war against our people – precisely against the people, against all Ukrainians from Lutsk to Kharkiv, from Sumy to Odesa. And I am grateful to every leader, I am grateful to every nation – our partners who understand that Russia's large-scale ""investment"" in terror is already, imagine, more than 4,000 missiles! It's necessary to exceed it with even more help to the people against whom this terror is directed., This week we received important decisions from the EU, partner countries in Europe, the United States, which will help maintain stability now and in the coming year. This applies to defense support, energy support, and macro-financial assistance for Ukraine. But there is still work to be done. There are still vital decisions awaiting final approval and implementation., In particular, I will constantly remind... Dear partners! Find an opportunity to give Ukraine reliable protection of the sky, a reliable air defense shield. You can do it. You can give protection to our people – one hundred percent protection from these terrorist Russian strikes., When this happens, the main form of Russian terror – missile terror – will become simply impossible. And this will mean safety for Ukrainians, safety for millions of people and a strategic realignment of the entire military situation. The fewer opportunities Russia has for terror, the more opportunities we will have to restore and guarantee peace., We are already preparing for the international events that are planned for the near future – both political and more global, which include not only traditional political audiences, but also all people of the world who value peace and are ready to support our defense against Russian terror. You will see everything., Also on Monday, a meeting of the leaders of the Northern European countries will take place: the UK, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Iceland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Norway. These are our extremely important friends, important partners and effective helpers in our defense. So we are preparing several new proposals from Ukraine, how to strengthen us all, all the countries of Europe., I thank everyone who helps Ukraine! Thank you to all our energy workers, everyone who works to supply heat and water, everyone who repairs communications damaged by shelling and restores, and restores, and restores normal life every time, no matter how the terrorists try to leave us in the cold and in the dark. The terrorists will still lose., Glory to all those who hold back hell in Bakhmut and other areas in Donetsk region!, Glory to all who hold our front!, Glory to Ukraine!"
16 December 2022  - 20:01 ,"Russia still has enough missiles for several massive strikes, we have enough determination and self-belief to return ours – address of the President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, First of all, I thank our Air Force fighters, our counter aircraft fighters, intelligence and everyone who protects and helps protect the Ukrainian sky. Today's result is 60 shot down missiles. All air commands – Center, South, East and West were active., And the fighters of the 96th anti-aircraft missile brigade, which protect Kyiv region, were especially effective. Over 40 terrorists' missiles were destroyed in the sky of the central regions of the country and near Kyiv. I thank you, warriors!, But, unfortunately, there is a hit. Terrorists need such a large number of missiles in an attack that at least part of their ""products"" reaches their intended targets. All their targets today are civilian, and these are mainly energy and heat supply facilities. Probably, as a result of this war, the meaning of the word ""terror"" for most people in the world will be associated primarily with such crazy actions of Russia., In Kryvy Rih, the demolition of the rubble of a residential building, which was hit by one of the Russian missiles, continued all day. The list of the dead so far includes three. My condolences to all the relatives... More than ten people were injured, including children. Everyone gets help., Emergency power outages were applied today across the country – in most cities and regions. In Kyiv and 14 regions, as a result of power outages, water supply halted., Our power engineers and repair crews have already started working during the air alert and are doing everything possible to restore generation and supply. It takes time. But it will be., I ask all our people to be patient now and I thank everyone whose job is to restore normality at any time and under any circumstances. I also ask the representatives of regional and local authorities to be more active in creating an additional reserve of energy strength. Please work more actively with business so that more companies join the Points of Invincibility map., And I ask everyone now – of course, if possible – to take care of those who have the most difficulties... The elderly, families with children, displaced people from war zones or from the occupied territory. If you can help, please help., No matter what the missile worshipers from Moscow are hoping for, it still won't change the balance of power in this war. They still have enough missiles for several such heavy strikes. We have enough determination and self-belief to return our own after these blows., And one more., The European Union approved the ninth package of sanctions against Russia during the war. Ninth, but obviously not the last. Because it is obvious that the pressure needs to be increased., I thank all those leaders and countries who fought for a stronger package., But we will work with the European Commission, with the leaders of the EU countries, with the European public, so that the existing sanctions policy works towards the end of the war and does not give Russia wrong signals – signals that someone is ready to ease the pressure., I thank everyone who keeps to principles!, Glory to all who work for our victory!, Glory to all our soldiers, who heroically repel all attempts of Russian mercenaries to gain a foothold in Bakhmut! 17th separate tank brigade, 46th separate airmobile brigade – glory to you guys!, Glory to all who fight for Ukraine!, Air Force – Thanks again!, And the last. I will repeat constantly. Dear our partners, find an opportunity to provide us with a reliable air defense shield. This is saving people's lives., Glory to Ukraine!"
15 December 2022  - 22:58 ,"The invaders cannot defeat our army, so they destroy every city and village; the only way to stop it is to push them out of our land - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Briefly about today., First. There is a confirmation of the macro-financial aid from the European Union for Ukraine for the next year. The volume is 18 billion euros. This is a good result., Second. I spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau. It was a good conversation - we are preparing to strengthen our defense cooperation. I am grateful to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and all Canadians for the principled leadership on sanctions policy. Every sanction step against Russia for the war that has already been taken by the free world really helps us bring peace closer., Third. We are preparing important international events for the next week. Something that could give Ukraine more defense support this winter, more military capabilities., During another Russian shelling of Kherson today, a projectile hit the aid station of the Red Cross. The woman who died was a paramedic, a volunteer. My condolences to the relatives... Just since the beginning of this day, Russia has shelled Kherson more than 16 times! Only in one day! And it is so every day., Today, communities of the Kharkiv region were shelled again..., Today in Donbas, as in all previous weeks, brutal Russian attacks continue. The occupiers throw everyone and everything they have into the offensive. They cannot defeat our army, so they physically destroy every town and village so that there are no buildings, not even walls, that can be used for any kind of defense..., The only way to stop this is to push out Russian terrorists step by step from our Ukrainian land. To continue the pressure on Russia. To find new ways to hold every Russian terrorist, every Russian oligarch who helps the terrorist state and all Russian officials and propagandists to account for everything they do. Do against Ukraine, against freedom as such., Thank you to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who holds the front in Donbas, in the south, who holds the border, who protects our sky and our people., Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for freedom! , Glory to Ukraine!"
15 December 2022  - 14:13 ,Macro-financial support for Ukraine and strengthening EU sanctions against Russia are also weapons in the defense of freedom - President's speech at the meeting of the European Council,", Thank you very much, Charles! Thank you very much, Mr. President!, Dear colleagues! I am glad to greet you all., Next week, December 23, it will be six months since Ukraine obtained the status of a candidate for joining the European Union., And we wasted no time - Ukraine and all of Europe became stronger in six months. We maintain unity - and that is why we find effective answers to any anti-European challenges. We continue to defend our common values together, and therefore together we achieve tangible victories., In six months, we returned the territory of the Kharkiv region to Ukraine and all of Europe, returned the city of Kherson and part of the Kherson region, which were occupied by Russia at the beginning of the invasion. This liberation showed the world that our common defense is not something accidental, but an inalienable and unstoppable force of ours., , And I thank you for the large-scale and multifaceted assistance to Ukraine, which allows us to return freedom to our people, our cities, our villages. Nothing else proves the strength of Europe more clearly than the tears of gratitude in the eyes of the people we are liberating from the Russian occupation - in particular, thanks to your support., I thank you very much!, During these six months, we started the construction of an air shield for Ukraine, and therefore - the creation of one of the key security guarantees for the whole of Europe. When we have a sufficiently powerful and modern air defense and missile defense system, we will be able to dismantle the basis of Russian terror, namely, we will destroy Russia's ability to destroy others. I am grateful to all our partners who help us with air defense and missile defense, guaranteeing the security of the entire eastern flank of Europe., In six months, we not only preserved the full spectrum of political initiative, but also found a solution to overcome the unprecedented crises provoked by Russia., In particular, we have taken globally useful steps to stop the food crisis and prevent a new migrant crisis, which could hit at least the entire south of our continent., I am grateful to everyone who supported our grain export initiative, who has already joined our humanitarian initiative ""Grain From Ukraine"" and who helps create new logistics and export-import opportunities in all parts of Europe, which strengthen all of us., And right now we see what internal strength Europe has to guarantee energy security and protect itself from the social outbreaks that our common enemy so hoped for., Europe prepared for winter in conditions where Russia artificially created an absolutely insane deficit on the gas market. Now we see that this madness has hit not Europe, but the gas industry of Russia itself., I am grateful to all of you who are helping Ukraine overcome the most cynical form of terror that has ever been on our continent - energy terror., The Russian bet on the destruction of our energy infrastructure, our energy industry, and therefore on a humanitarian catastrophe for tens of millions of Ukrainians and all our neighboring countries in the EU remains. Therefore, we still need your support for energy, and therefore social resilience., , Dear colleagues! Europe!, The next six months will be decisive in many respects in the confrontation that Russia started with this aggression. Aggression against Ukraine and against each of you, because the ultimate target of Russia is much further than our border and Ukrainian sovereignty., The next six months will demand even greater efforts from us than this past time., First, Russia's energy terror must be defeated in all its forms., Any Russian energy blackmail, any destructive actions by Russia against critical infrastructure in Ukraine or, for example, against underwater cables and gas pipelines in Europe, any attempts to destabilize the gas and oil markets or nuclear energy sector must receive strong responses from all of Europe., From this point of view, the idea of price caps for Russian energy exports is extremely useful. The stronger such an instrument will be, the lower the price caps, the more stable the global energy market will be., And we urge you to agree on effective price caps for oil, oil products, and gas from Russia. These price caps should definitely deprive the terrorist state of the ability to finance the war at the expense of the global market., And the ultimate goal of the entire energy strategy of Europe should be the complete independence of our continent from dirty Russian energy resources. I assure you that, from this perspective, Ukraine will be able to become a new reliable major supplier of green energy resources for the whole of Europe., The second is the winter resilience of Ukraine. , Russia wants to break your security by destroying our infrastructure. Any blackouts in Ukraine are strikes at your social systems due to new waves of migration. Any attempts by Russia to show that Ukraine does not have sufficient resilience are attempts to show you, the world, that Europe does not have sufficient resilience., Therefore I urge you to continue doing everything so that we can maintain the energy supply for Ukrainians. And I am grateful to each and every one of you who are already helping with the supply of equipment and financial support. But now, in order for the next six months to pass without upheavals, something more needs to be done., In particular, we need support in the purchase of the volume of gas that is used to compensate for the damage caused by Russian strikes at other types of generation. It is about two billion cubic meters of gas., We also need support with electricity for Ukraine - with supply from the EU. Just as we can help you by exporting electricity when we get our generation back up, we need your help now to get us through this winter. It is about the supply of electricity worth about eight hundred million euros., The third aspect is defensive support. It should be no less than in the past six months. This is critically important for the protection of Ukrainian freedom and the very idea of Europe in the global confrontation with Russia., But apart from this, we need more modern weapons, more supply., This applies to both air defense and missile defense. And I ask each of the twenty-seven countries of the European Union to decide what specifically you can do to increase the supply of air defense and missile defense systems., This also applies to modern tanks. There is no rational reason why Ukraine should not receive them now. I am asking you to show leadership - the first one to provide modern tanks will open this supply possibility to the whole world and will be remembered as one of the most important defenders of freedom in our time., This also applies to longer-range artillery and missile systems that could speed up the end of Russian aggression., All this is a direct saving of millions of lives., The fourth is diplomacy. , Over the past six months, we have developed and offered to the world a Peace Formula that contains everything necessary not only to end this war, but also to guarantee, reliably and permanently, that there will be no repetition of the same or the beginning of any other war in Europe., I urge you to support the Ukrainian Peace Formula! You all know its elements - they are logical, effective, and can be implemented already in the next six months. For this purpose, in the near future we are organizing a summit - Global Peace Formula Summit., I hope to see all of you and your leadership in helping peace at this summit. Pay attention - each of the points of our Peace Formula allows each conscientious country to show its leadership and help with this or that specific goal., In fact, it is like a menu - for manifestations of leadership. And these are really opportunities for all countries to contribute to the security of Ukraine, the whole of Europe, and the world. These are opportunities both for those who are more active in international relations and for those who, so far, do less to protect peace., And the fifth - for the next six months. A task based on values., , I want to thank all of you once again for supporting Ukraine in obtaining the candidate status. Now is the time to take another step., Despite the war, we do not stop the institutional transformation of our state. This week alone, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine approved three European integration laws: the law on national communities, the law on modernization of the principles of work of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, and on the media sphere., And this is just one illustration of the many things we have done in order to prepare the next stage of rapprochement between Ukraine and the EU. Namely, the assessment of the implementation of the recommendations of the European Commission, which we expect from you in the near future. And we strongly ask you to do this, and to speed up this process, so that we can proceed to the start of negotiations regarding Ukraine's membership in the EU., I believe that everything emphasized by me today will be implemented. Because for Ukraine and for Europe, when we are together, nothing is impossible. We will defeat any terror, we will implement any of our joint tasks., I thank you for your attention! And I thank you for the support!, I would like to express special gratitude for your steps on sanctions over the past six months, for the package of financial support for our country in the amount of 18 billion euros for the next year, which can be finally approved at the leadership level right now. This is vital., And Charles, my friend, I am asking you very much to ensure that our struggle for peace for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe does not depend on misunderstandings and controversies between some EU member states., The packages of macro-financial support for Ukraine are also weapons in defense of freedom. Just as the ninth package of EU sanctions against Russia. This is our protection. Please understand that!, I hope that already in January we will be able to thank you for the first tranche of this macro-financial package., Thanks again for your attention!, Long live Europe!, Glory to Ukraine!"
14 December 2022  - 20:10 ,We are preparing agreements that will strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, First of all, I want to thank our anti-aircraft gunners and the Air Force for repelling another attack by Iranian drones this morning., The skies of the Kyiv region are defended by the 96th anti-aircraft missile brigade of the Air Force. Thank you guys!
 A total of 13 Shaheds were shot down. These are 13 saved infrastructure objects, these are saved lives. In one morning., I held a meeting of the Staff today. We talked, in particular, about the protection of the sky. We are constantly strengthening our air defense and anti-drone defense. And we are doing everything to get more modern and more powerful systems for Ukraine., This week we have made important progress on the air defense issue., Of course, the situation in Donbas and other active areas on the frontline was discussed in great detail at the Staff meeting. There is no calm on the frontline. There is nothing easy and simple. Every day and every meter is given extremely hard. Especially where the entire tactic of the occupiers boils down to the destruction of everything in front of them with artillery, so that only bare ruins and craters in the ground remain., Today, by the way, I spoke about it in an address to the European Parliament. Russia is destroying city after city in Donbas, like Mariupol, like Volnovakha, like Bakhmut. Defense in such conditions is not just heroism, it is something more. And I thank all our warriors who withstand the pressure of the occupiers., I would like to note the warriors of the 46th separate airmobile brigade, who very skillfully and bravely defeated the enemy during another attack and forced him to retreat. Well done! , I would also like to note the warriors of the 80th and 95th separate airborne assault brigades who are fighting in the Kreminna direction - and very effectively. Thank you, warriors!, We are preparing agreements that will strengthen our defense capabilities and give Ukraine more operational capabilities., We also do not slow down our activity for the sake of creating a special tribunal for Russian aggression and holding all those responsible for it to account. Today I called on our friends in Europe and members of the European Parliament to step up their efforts to make the tribunal finally operational. The terrorist state must bear responsibility for every burned Ukrainian city, for every destroyed life of our people. And it will bear it., I spoke today with International Olympic Committee President Bach., In particular, about the fact that the principles of the Olympic movement definitely do not envisage conniving with terrorist states. Any ideas on how to get Russian representatives back to international competitions are ideas on how to allow those guilty of terror to tell their society that the world supposedly condones terror. This is a sports indulgence. This is how it will be presented by Russian propaganda if the International Olympic Committee fails and allows those who represent war and nothing else to participate in sporting events on an equal footing with others., I do not want to clarify whether there are any motives behind such ideas about the return of Russia. But no one will turn a blind eye to any attempt to reduce international pressure on the source of the war., When we receive reports like today from Kherson, where a child, a boy, was killed by yet another Russian shelling... He was eight years old... We can only say one thing: a white or any neutral flag is impossible for Russian athletes, all their flags are bloodstained., Today, I held very important negotiations with UN Secretary-General Guterres. I thanked him for his constant support of Ukraine and international law, for effective assistance in the implementation of our initiatives, such as ""Grain from Ukraine"". We are currently working on organizing missions with an international mandate to the objects of the critical energy infrastructure of our state. I believe that this can also be successful., And one more thing., Today, 64 Ukrainians were returned from Russian captivity. 64 warriors. Four officers and 60 privates and sergeants. Among them are seriously wounded. We provide adequate assistance to everyone., We continue to work to free and return home every Ukrainian man and woman still held captive in Russia. I would like to thank our team that ensures the exchanges., I thank everyone who works for Ukrainians and Ukraine!, Glory to all who fight for our country!, Glory to all who fill with their courage and effectiveness the word that is now heard all over the world - the word “Ukraine”., And I want to separately thank ""Plast"" today, our Ukrainian scouts, guides for the Peace Light of Bethlehem, which they brought to Ukraine. Let this light support all of us, all Ukrainians., Glory to Ukraine!"
14 December 2022  - 15:30 ,"The most effective protection of freedom, human rights and the rule of law is to hold to account all those who started the war - President of Ukraine at the presentation of the Sakharov Prize",", Thank you Roberta!, Dear Mrs. President, dear Roberta!, Dear friends!, Greetings to you on behalf of all our people, it is a great honor for me. Greetings from all those who fight, who work for the sake of Ukraine and for the sake of freedom. For the sake of everything without which it is impossible to imagine all of us, life, Europe. Impossible to imagine without Ukraine and without freedom. And not only because it will simply be untrue., , But also because any attempt to deprive Europe of Ukraine and freedom is always a crime., And we see such a crime now - Russia's terrorist war against Ukraine and Europe. This was also the case in the past, when tyrannies tried to subjugate Ukrainians and deprive all Europeans of their freedom., But when we win now - Ukrainians and all Europeans - we will win in such a way that there will never again be attempts to deprive Europe of Ukraine and freedom. We will win in such a way that there will be no attempt to apply genocidal policy against our people again, both in Ukraine and throughout Europe., We have to give - and we will! – a new effective security architecture for global freedom and international legal order. I consider this part of our common moral obligation., Look at the offensive of the Russian army. The occupiers are burning everything in front of them - with artillery and missiles, bombs and drones, mines, ordnance that did not explode and remains in our land. The occupiers are destroying cities and villages and all vital infrastructure..., This was the case in Mariupol - you all saw it. This was the case in Volnovakha, another city that was completely destroyed after the Russian offensive. More than 20 thousand people lived there before this war. Now there are total ruins. The Russian army is doing the same with Bakhmut, another city of Donbas, which Russian strikes turn into broken stones. More than 70,000 people used to live there... Just recently. Last year. Now there are ruins., , Perhaps only after the end of this war, when we liberate all our land and can discover all the graves of the victims of Russian terror, will we be able to say how many lives tyranny took this time., Now we know thousands of names of the dead. Unfortunately, there may be many more of them., I ask all of you to honor with a moment of silence the memory of all Ukrainian men, all Ukrainian women, all adults and children, all soldiers, all civilians, whose lives were taken by this disgraceful war!, Thank you very much!, Dear friends! It is necessary to act now - without waiting for the end of the war - to hold to account all those who started it, and to prevent any repetition of aggression. This will be the most effective protection of freedom, human rights, the rule of law and other common values of ours, which are embodied, in particular, by this award of the European Parliament - the Sakharov Prize., I am grateful to everyone who investigates and helps investigate the crimes of the occupiers in Ukraine, who is looking for information about Russian murderers and terrorists. I am grateful to the International Criminal Court, which closely cooperates with Ukrainian prosecutors and has a clear intention to ensure justice for what the occupiers committed on the territory of our country. And I am grateful to all the leaders and states, all the politicians and international organizations who are working together with us and are making every possible effort to create a tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. I call on all of you, your parties and states to effectively support this work!, The tribunal must start working. , The European Parliament has already supported this idea. It is necessary to turn it into reality as soon as possible., In particular, through the adoption of a separate resolution of the European Parliament in support of the creation of the Tribunal, through your support and the support of your countries for the corresponding resolution of the UN General Assembly. The cities and villages destroyed by Russia, destroyed destinies, broken and executed lives should be reflected in the sentences not only for those who directly committed all this, but also in the sentences for those who organized and started this aggression., , And when the principle of the inevitability of punishment works for the crime of aggression against Ukraine, we will be able to make the corresponding institutional basis of justice permanently effective. When any potential aggressor knows that punishment for criminal war is inevitable, it will be the most effective tool for war prevention., And one more thing. Historical responsibility. Evil always has a motive to return when the history of evil is not fully written., Dear deputies!, I know that tomorrow you will consider the issue of recognizing the Holodomor crime against the Ukrainian people as genocide. And I urge you to support such a recognition with the maximum majority of votes for the sake of justice., Europe should give the strongest possible signal that there will not be a single gap left in the history of tragedies on our continent, in the history of crimes against humanity and humanness committed on our land., I believe that it will be so!, Thank you for your support! Thank you for celebrating our struggle - for this award!, I thank you personally, Roberta, for supporting us - you came to Kyiv in a difficult, dangerous time, for supporting our reforms, our movement into European structures, and for really helping. Thank you!, Glory to all our warriors!, Glory to everyone who defends freedom and our people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
13 December 2022  - 23:09 ,I urge you to support the Ukrainian Peace Formula and to start the consolidation of the world for the sake of countering ecocide - speech by the President in the Parliament of New Zealand,", Dear friends!, Mrs. Prime Minister!, Mr. Speaker!, Mr. leader of the opposition!, Government officials and parliamentarians!, People of New Zealand!, I am grateful for this opportunity to address you and I would like to offer you leadership., Leadership in the protection of peace., This year has shown the world how much you can do when you have enough determination and know what to do., And let's be honest - at the beginning of this year, no one in the world expected sensations from Ukraine., When the full-scale invasion of Russia began, I heard only sympathy in the voices of many interlocutors. But when they heard determination in response, everything changed instantly., Everyone whose heart resonated with the Ukrainian struggle for freedom joined the global coalition for the defense of freedom., Today, our anti-war coalition already includes more than a hundred states. Those who support the fundamental principles of international law and the UN Charter., Those who in international institutions - for example in the UN General Assembly - vote for decisions in favor of peace and territorial integrity of Ukraine., Those who provide our state with armed support and train our military., Those who imposed sanctions against the terrorist state and constantly raise the price for Russia for aggression and the global crises provoked by it. And those who help us solve these crises., Those who do everything to hold Russian war criminals to account for what they have committed against Ukraine., In 293 days of this terrible war, the very developments created opportunities for various countries and leaders to show themselves - to find their function in the protection of what all of us in the world value anyway., , And I am grateful to you, dear friends, for the fact that New Zealand was one of the first to start supporting Ukraine in the struggle for independence and justice., Having felt the peculiarity of the moral challenge of this war, you changed your own approaches to sanctions policy and applied national sanctions against those involved in inciting aggression., You helped with finances for security needs, with the supply of ammunition and with the training of the military., You provided us with humanitarian support and you always help on international platforms., We in Ukraine appreciate all this very much. I thank you again for this support!, But I would like to offer you something more., Various dictators and aggressors always do not realize that the strength of the free world is not that someone is big and accumulated missiles, but that everyone knows how to unite and act decisively, sincerely, and that everyone makes their unique contribution to the common cause., Maybe it is time for your country to make just such a unique contribution., I am talking now about one of the points of our Peace Formula, which I proposed recently at the G19 summit held in Indonesia., So, you have probably heard about 10 points that can restore peace to Ukraine and all of Europe, and restore security and stability to the world, which were shattered by Russian strikes. These are very transparent and logical points., This is radiation and nuclear security. Food security. Energy security. Release of all prisoners of war and return of deportees. Full implementation of the UN Charter and restoration of territorial integrity of Ukraine. Withdrawal of Russian troops from our land and, thanks to this, cessation of hostilities. Restoring justice through the prosecution of war criminals. Countering ecocide. Preventing the escalation of the war and fixing its end., Each of these points is capable of removing one or another element of Russian aggression., And therefore, they all guarantee peace., And I suggested convening a special summit in the coming months. Global Peace Formula Summit, at which the partner states could decide which of the points of the Peace Formula they could help implement., Similar to how we implement the second point of the Formula - food security. There is a format of cooperation with the UN, with Türkiye, with other partners, and as a result, there are two initiatives that remove from the global food market the deficit that arose due to the criminal Russian blockade of our seaports. We unblocked three Ukrainian seaports. The results of this are obvious., Our grain export initiative and Grain From Ukraine humanitarian initiative are now working together to solve the problem of global famine. By the way, please inquire about them. Perhaps you will see your role in mitigating the food crisis as well., But still, first of all, I urge you to pay attention to the eighth point of our Peace Formula. The point on environmental security., , Educated people understand well what war means for the natural environment. Your society is just that - educated., The destroyed economy and infrastructure can be rebuilt. It takes years., But you cannot rebuild destroyed nature. Just as you cannot restore destroyed life. , As of now, 174,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory are contaminated with mines and unexploded ordnance. , The water area of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov is also contaminated with mines and has lost hundreds of thousands of living creatures who died as a result of hostilities and the activity of the Russian navy. , Dozens of rivers are polluted. Hundreds of coal mines are flooded. Dozens of the most hazardous enterprises, including chemical ones, were destroyed by Russian strikes., Three million hectares of forests in Ukraine are affected by hostilities., All this and other manifestations of the Russian ecocidal policy will have direct negative repercussions for millions of people, for our region and neighboring regions., I am sure that your society feels the fragility of our world. Feels how important it is for all people on the planet to conduct a rational policy in relation to our common home. By the way, just as in relation to our common values, on which the peaceful coexistence of nations is based., And that is why I suggest that your country, your leaders consider taking into account this environmental point of our Peace Formula. I urge you to show leadership in international institutions, in particular in the UN, and on a bilateral level with other states, so that the world can see this challenge of the Russian war., So that the world sees that there is no real peace where any child can die from a hidden Russian anti-personnel mine. There is no real peace where the consequences of war in the form of poisoned groundwater can destroy normal life in several countries. There is no real peace where ecocide has taken place, and its consequences have not been overcome., Perhaps now it seems that there will be no great sensations from such a topic. But until today, the world does not have a common experience of overcoming the destructive impact of war on the natural environment., We will liberate our land. We will win this war - I am sure of it. We will return freedom and security to all Ukrainians, no matter where they live., The countries of the world are already taking the lead in implementing such points of our Peace Formula, such as, for example, the point on justice. Yesterday, the Netherlands announced its readiness to host a tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine., And I urge you to support the Ukrainian Peace Formula in your parliament and start the consolidation of the world for the sake of the eighth point of the Formula - for the sake of countering ecocide., Let Russia be held to account for all manifestations of its aggression., I thank you for your attention!, Nga mihi!, Glory to Ukraine!"
13 December 2022  - 22:20 ,"The story of DACK is over, the story of reforms continues even during the war - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today was a very fruitful day for Ukraine. In different aspects., We have very good news from France - two conferences in support of Ukraine were held there today. Their first result is €1 billion in aid to our resilience, primarily energy., Every day we gain new strength for Ukraine to get through this winter, and I thank everyone who works for this and who helps our state., Today, we also have decisions from other countries, besides France, - the Czech Republic, Spain, Switzerland - to provide additional support packages. The Italian Senate passed a decision on armed support. Norway is preparing a new program to support our state and people..., I took part in both conferences in Paris today. The first concerned to a greater extent our interstate relations. The second forum was focused on French business., Ukrainian government officials presented French entrepreneurs with opportunities to invest in Ukraine already now, when the war is still going on, and after our victory. We also discussed what we can do additionally to strengthen our state at the European level., Today in France, the First Lady of Ukraine presents humanitarian projects to our partners. What can be done as quickly as possible to support our people in the field of healthcare, education and humanitarian aid, in particular through Olena’s Foundation. And I am grateful to all the French for their support of Ukraine - not only political, not only defense and sanctions, which is vitally important. But also for the fact that we equally perceive the need to protect the value of human life, human dignity and the humanitarian opportunities that the modern world gives to everyone., I spoke with President of the European Council Charles Michel. I thanked for the decision regarding 18 billion euros for Ukraine next year and for increasing the European Peace Facility by 2 billion euros. These funds can greatly help us maintain social stability. I am also preparing to participate in the meeting of the European Council on December 15., I have just addressed the parliament and people of New Zealand, a country that has fundamentally supported us since the first weeks of full-scale Russian aggression. I’ve told about our peace formula, about the special summit that we are convening to implement our formula. And I called on New Zealand to take the lead in supporting at the international level one of the clauses of the peace formula - the one related to environmental security and demining., New Zealand is one of those countries that understands that the destruction of the natural environment is equal to the destruction of life, and that can help the diplomatic mobilization of its region in order to implement the Ukrainian peace formula., And one more thing., Today I signed the Law adopted by the Verkhovna Rada on the liquidation of the District Administrative Court of Kyiv. This story is over. And the story of reforms continues - continues even during such a war., Thank you to everyone who works for Ukraine! , Thank you to everyone who is fighting for our independence, who is currently at the front, who is currently struggling! We support you, we strongly believe in you., Glory to all our warriors! , Glory to our indomitable people! , Glory to Ukraine!"
13 December 2022  - 19:05 ,"The more effectively we combine the power of Ukraine and France, the more we will benefit from it, the more reliable peace will be - President's address to the participants of the forum on the resilience and reconstruction of Ukraine in Paris",", Thank you very much., Thank you to all the attendees., Thank you, Emmanuel, for all the words - the words of support - that you just said., The words of support for our society, Ukraine. Thank you very much for the news - it is important, pragmatic, yet very important and pleasant regarding the large contribution, regarding the support for Ukraine in the amount of 1 billion - it is really very important for us., And I want to say in general, Mr. President, I feel it and thank you once again for the fact that this day really became the day of Ukraine in France., This is extremely important - and not only for our country. I am sure that now we can feel how strong we all are together - Ukrainians, French, all Europeans., , Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear friends!, We can feel it in the way we implement our values in overcoming the ruins brought by Russia. Any tyranny leaves ruins behind. On the contrary, European democracy must guarantee well-being and security - and this is exactly what we can show now. Show in Ukraine., That is why such an extended format of our work is important. Interstate cooperation at the level of presidents and governments - and cooperation at the level of local communities. The leading role of French business. Your non-governmental and professional associations., Today here, at our Forum and at the Conference that took place in the morning, at other events, the full power of French society is represented. And I believe that thanks to the timely investment of your strength in Ukraine, we will achieve equally beneficial results for both Ukraine and France, for ordinary Ukrainians, and for all your citizens., To list everything that was destroyed by Russia in Ukraine, all our needs for reconstruction and modernization, time set in regulations for this meeting of ours won’t be enough for sure., I will focus on several areas now., The first is the Chernihiv region of our country, the region over which France has already taken patronage. , We’ve ousted the Russian army from there in the spring already. The hostilities in the Chernihiv region, as well as in other northern regions of Ukraine, lasted less than in the east or the south. But there is also significant destruction there., In general, 8,896 objects need to be restored in the Chernihiv region only in the framework of the Fast Recovery Plan - i.e. the objects that require immediate efforts. These are more than a thousand apartment buildings that were damaged or destroyed by shelling. More than 7 thousand private houses. And also hospitals, schools, communications, transport, enterprises. And this is only one region!, Part of the work is already underway. In particular, France has already provided us with assistance in the restoration of bridges. But both for the French state and for French companies, there are much more opportunities and projects that need implementation., Today, Ukrainian government officials will present our needs for the fast recovery. And I invite you all to join! Join now - including in the framework of France's patronage over the Chernihiv region., In total, hostilities directly affected the territory of eleven regions. The scope of our Fast Recovery Plan, which covers other regions as well, is more than fifty thousand objects and more than 12 billion euros., , The second direction is charity., In her speech at the Conference in the morning, the First Lady of Ukraine presented a project to restore one of the hospitals of the Kharkiv region of Ukraine, the hub hospital in the city of Izyum. This is one of those projects for which Olena’s Foundation raises funds., Today, the Foundation will be presented in France, thank you for that. All areas of its work will be presented. These are education, healthcare and humanitarian aid. , In each of these directions, people, public associations and companies of France can show themselves. And I ask you, Emmanuel, Mr. President, and I ask Mrs. Brigitte Macron to support this Foundation and, if possible, to be present there today., This is now an unconditional moral dominant in our society - everyone strives to do something that will strengthen us all - all of Ukraine., Someone can help the defense. Someone keeps jobs and even creates new ones - during the war. Someone joins the reconstruction. Thousands of people show volunteer initiative, participate in relevant projects. And also there is the social sphere - education, medicine, assistance to the elderly and assistance to displaced people... I invite all of you, friends, to choose your own direction!, And the third is the economy. , The already mentioned Chernihiv region and all other regions of our country need a new economic basis for life. Of course, all the details will be presented today by our government officials. But I will now draw your attention to something that you have undoubtedly already heard about., This year, due to the joint efforts of Ukraine and our partners, we managed to stop the spread of the global food crisis. We have restored seaborne agricultural exports from Ukraine, which have been blocked by the Russian fleet since the start of the full-scale war. Since August of this year, we have already exported more than 13 million tons of food., We also launched the globally important humanitarian initiative ""Grain from Ukraine"" - and I thank France and President Macron for supporting it. Thanks to this initiative of ours, we will help the poorest countries in the world with food. Such countries as Ethiopia, Yemen, Sudan, and others. This is the salvation of millions of lives from famine and all the countries of the Mediterranean Basin from outbreaks of the migration crisis., But, friends, we send mainly agricultural raw materials both for export and as humanitarian cargo. And we can send processed products., , It means that right now we need to develop an entire industry, which will be export-oriented, will definitely have consumers and will definitely be profitable. It is obvious that this is a profitable economic project. And it would be expedient for the French business to already assess the prospects and come to Ukraine for such a project., Likewise, we now have tremendous opportunities in energy, engineering, defense industry, transport, construction, IT and many other industries. Opportunities that you will not find anywhere else in the world now. Only in Ukraine can a large-scale project of ecological and modern re-industrialization be implemented quite quickly, and we have a clear understanding of how to do it., I know that today the representatives of our state will invite specific companies to cooperate and will outline the general prospects - what exactly we can offer to French business and what decisions we need at the level of the French state., Please join in! First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko and representative of the Office of the President Rostyslav Shurma will present specific areas of possible cooperation., The sooner and more effectively we combine the power of Ukraine and France, the more we will benefit from it. And the more reliable peace will be, which, I am sure, we will be able to return to our country and all of Europe., I thank you for your attention!, Thank you, Emmanuel., Please be proactive today in your communication with our government officials., Long live France!, Glory to Ukraine!"
13 December 2022  - 12:54 ,"We need the Paris Mechanism, which will help give timely responses to the challenges of Russian energy terror - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of ""In solidarity with the Ukrainian People"" conference",", Thank you very much!, Dear President Macron!, Mrs. President von der Leyen!, President Cassis!, Prime Minister Støre!, Prime Minister Hun Sen!, Prime Minister Bettel!, Prime Minister Fiala!, Dear heads of international institutions!, Prime Minister Shmyhal!, Dear Olena!, All attendees, ministers, ambassadors!, I am glad that we are united by such a new format - such a Conference. Because this means that we are united by the ability to defeat Russian energy terror., I remember how you, Emmanuel, called me on November 1 and offered to organize such a format. There have already been massive missile strikes against our energy sector. The constant terror of Iranian drones has already begun. Russia has opened a new front against us, trying to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe of the scale of our entire country. Russia needs a blackout in Ukraine to use it as an alleged defeat of Europe and all our democratic resistance., In response, we established a new format of cooperation and do everything for the sake of the country, for the sake of Ukrainians, against blackouts, against energy terror., What do we have for today?, , Ukraine withstood hundreds of Russian strikes of varying intensity at our energy sector. But now most of our power plants are unfortunately damaged or destroyed by shelling. All hydroelectric power plants, all thermal power plants... God forbid, but imagine what this would mean in your countries., One of the Russian strikes provoked the shutdown of all the nuclear units of our nuclear power plants, automation was activated - fortunately, without incident., At least one and a half billion euros are needed only for the superficial quick restoration of Ukrainian energy facilities destroyed by Russian strikes., Every time, after every Russian strike, we try to restore the technical ability to generate and supply electricity. Nevertheless, every day our energy workers have to disconnect millions of Ukrainians from the supply due to a critical shortage of electricity in the general energy system., Right now, about 12 million people in almost all regions and the capital are disconnected from the supply. Unfortunately, this is a typical situation for us. And we expect new Russian strikes every day, which can dramatically increase the number of shutdowns., That is why generators and uninterruptible power sources have now become as necessary in Ukraine as armored vehicles and bulletproof vests. This is the only way to protect ordinary people and the social order in the conditions of the Russian bid for blackout. In fact, a decentralized energy generation system parallel to the main one is currently being built in Ukraine. It is being built very quickly, in all regions, by many subjects., But still, it cannot meet all the needs of Ukraine., Yes, thousands of Ukrainian enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses, social facilities continue to work thanks to generators., Yes, hospitals function on generators, hundreds of thousands of jobs have already been saved thanks to generators, the Internet and communications are insured against outages., More than 5,000 Points of Invincibility have been opened across the country - special facilities where people can warm up, charge equipment and use communications., And I am grateful to all our partners who are already helping Ukraine with the appropriate equipment to maintain such a level of energy sustainability of our state and society., But still, the key task is to preserve the main energy system of Ukraine, to guarantee its stable operation despite any Russian efforts to make Ukraine the darkest place in Europe., That is why such a format is needed., Here and now we have to agree on specific things that will not only help Ukraine endure the winter. They will also prove as clearly as possible to any anti-democratic and anti-European forces, and primarily to Russia, that Europe has learned to prevent catastrophe and protect its people., Ladies and Gentlemen!, I will be as specific as possible now., First. We need several categories of equipment - these are transformers, equipment for restoring high-voltage networks, gas turbine and gas piston power units. Ukrainian representatives who are present at the Conference can inform you about all the technical characteristics of this request., Second. At least until the end of this heating season in Ukraine, we need emergency support from the European energy system. That is, the supply of electricity from the countries of the European Union to Ukraine. The volume is up to two gigawatts., For this to become possible, a decision of ENTSO-E to increase import capacity is necessary. Again, all the technical details of such a decision will be presented by our government officials who are present at the Conference., Such electricity supply support could cost around 800 million euros in current prices. This is significant. But significantly less than a blackout in Ukraine could cost us all. Therefore, I urge you to make one of the concrete results of this Conference the approval of all decisions for such support of Ukraine with the supply of electricity from EU countries., Third. By analogy with the observation missions of the IAEA, which have been agreed to be sent to all nuclear power plants of Ukraine, we call on the European Union to send special missions to the objects of critical energy infrastructure, which are involved in the energy supply of Ukraine and on which the stability of our entire region directly depends. Such EU missions could become a reliable factor in stabilizing the situation and proper international control., Fourth. Due to the destruction of power plants by terrorists, we are forced to use more gas this winter than expected. As a result, we need support in the purchase of about two billion cubic meters of gas. It is also a necessary element of our stability that needs your leadership., Fifth. Another practical result of this Conference could be an agreement on the financing of the project, which Emmanuel has already started talking about, on the purchase of LED lamps for Ukraine. This may not seem significant to someone. But 50 million such lamps will save about one gigawatt of electricity. Given that the average deficit in our power system is about two and a half gigawatts, this project could also help significantly., And sixth. We need a special permanent mechanism for coordinating efforts - the Paris Mechanism. This will make it possible to provide timely and effective responses to every challenge of Russian energy terror. Unfortunately, we do not yet have such a modern air defense system that can shoot down Russian missiles and drones one hundred percent, however we can create such a decision-making system that can one hundred percent make Russia's terrorist tactics meaningless., When the energy stability of Ukraine is guaranteed for the entire winter period, when it is guaranteed that there will be no new waves of mass migration from our country to your countries, it will also be guaranteed that no strikes, no blackouts, no search for weapons somewhere out there in Iran or elsewhere will help Russia., Russia will have to think about how to stop aggression. Finally stop., Energy is one of the keys to this. I believe that this key will be in our hands, in your hands., Thank you for your attention!, Once again, thank you, Mr. President, Emmanuel, for organizing this Conference. I count on very specific decisions., Thank you!, Glory to Ukraine!"
12 December 2022  - 22:11 ,"Blackouts are the last hope of terrorists, but even without light, we know well where to shoot and what to liberate – address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, A report about the day that is coming to an end., First, I congratulated the warriors and commanders of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on their professional holiday. Today is their day. In the Mariyinsky Palace, I presented state awards - ""Gold Star"" orders, ""Cross of Combat Merit"" decorations, and other awards., And it was an emotional ceremony. There were relatives of the Heroes who gave their lives in battles against the invaders. There were warriors who would return to the frontline. And there was such a special moment when we all felt what united us and how much we were all waiting for our victory., The victory will definitely come., The second important event of the day was participation in the G7 leaders' summit. The Group of Seven. This is already the fifth such summit this year, in which Ukraine participates and fully presents its position. Today, we specifically outlined what we have to do next year., I thanked the partners and urged them to continue to help Ukraine in 2023 as they did this year. It is very important that all elements of support for our state are preserved and do not lose momentum. It is equally important to take new steps that will preempt the Russian terror., One of the main such steps is the summit, which we are planning for this winter. A summit on the implementation of our Peace Formula. No matter what the aggressor intends to do, when the world is truly united, it is the world, not the aggressor, that determines future developments. This is what we offer to all conscientious states. To everyone who values the UN Charter and simply peace., Thirdly, representatives of our state are already working in France. The head of the government, the First Lady of Ukraine and others. The key task is two conferences on the reconstruction and resilience of Ukraine, on getting through this winter. They will take place tomorrow. And also - the direction of French forces - both of the state and businesses, communities of France - to specific projects on the recovery of Ukraine. Energy sector, cities, enterprises, hospitals... So now is an important time in France for our country, and tomorrow I will also take part in the relevant events., And other extremely important things., Today, three of our EOD technicians - employees of the State Emergency Service - died in the Donetsk region during demining. My condolences to the relatives... Doctors are fighting for the lives of two more of their colleagues. It happened in Kostyantynivka, Kramatorsk district. One of our territories most contaminated by Russian landmines, tripwire mines and unexploded shells. Since February 24, employees of the State Emergency Service alone have removed more than 300,000 explosive items. The EOD technicians of the National Police removed more than 180,000 such items. And demining is also carried out by other state services and the army., And this is one of the most important areas of our communication with partners. Among other things, we must gather the maximum of global capabilities to overcome the Russian mine terror as soon as possible. And I thank once again all our partners who help. I am thankful to all our heroic employees of the State Emergency Service, our police, and the military who carry out demining. Every defused Russian mine, every disposed projectile, every detected and defused tripwire mine is the saved lives of our people., Every day we add new energy forces to Ukraine. After each Russian attack, we restore the system. As much as possible. We are doing everything to bring to Ukraine as much equipment as possible, which can compensate for the damage caused by missile hits. And I thank all Ukrainian entrepreneurs, volunteers, all our partners who help with this., But we should all be aware that Russia has not given up its terror tactics. The absence of massive missile strikes only means that the enemy is preparing for them and can strike at any time. Although it is obvious that even without light we know well where to shoot and what to liberate, Russia still hopes for blackouts. This is the last hope of terrorists..., So as long as they have missiles - and Russia still has them - please take seriously all warnings from the Ukrainian military command, from our Air Force and air alarms. At all levels, we must be prepared for any hostile intentions. And we will do everything to get through this winter., I thank everyone who helps Ukraine!, I thank everyone who works for our victory!, Glory to all who fight for independence!, Eternal memory to every Ukrainian whose life was taken by this war!, Glory to Ukraine!"
12 December 2022  - 19:51 ,I propose to convene the Global Peace Formula Summit to determine how we can implement the Ukrainian Peace Formula - address by the President to the G7 leaders,", I thank you, Mr. Chancellor, for your words of support and for convening this summit. , For the opportunity to thank all of you, dear friends, for not losing Ukraine this year! Just as for not losing Europe and the world based on fair rules., Millions of our people are fighting and working for the sake of freedom. It is thanks to your support that Ukrainian invincibility has gained so much strength., Today I want to acknowledge the leadership of each of you as well as the solidarity of the entire Group of Seven., I am grateful to the United States and all Americans for the large-scale military and economic support as well as the support with sanctions. The US has united the free world and established a solid foundation of our security solidarity. Thank you, Mr. President! Our phone call yesterday was substantive, thank you very much., I am grateful to Canada and all Canadians for making every Ukrainian feel the sheer power of our friendship. Thank you for solidarity in understanding that Russian aggression is a no local event, but a truly global threat - a threat to everyone on Earth. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister!, I am grateful to Japan and every Japanese for the strong leadership in Asia for the sake of protecting the freedom and basic norms of international law, as well as for the solidarity over the point that no threats brought by the Russian war should ruin the lives of our nation and all other nations of this planet. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister!, I am grateful to the United Kingdom and all of His Majesty's subjects for being the first in Europe to provide Ukraine with lethal weapons, for solidarity in building a powerful army, and for the unwavering belief in the victory over evil. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister!, I am grateful to France and all the French people for reinforcing our artillery and for supporting Ukraine both nationally and at the level of local communities. I am grateful for your solidarity in the vision of the European future - free and equal for all the nations of our continent. Thank you, Mr. President!, I am grateful to Italy and all Italians for the timely and unhesitating provision of security and financial support. I am grateful to you for solidarity in respect for human dignity, because Russia wants to deprive all free nations of their dignity, and not only in Europe. Thank you, Madam Prime Minister!, I am grateful to Germany and every German for the wonderful IRISes and for everything that helps us save people and maintain social stability despite Russia’s terror. No matter how Russia would blackmail us, we are confident about German solidarity in condemning the genocidal policy of Russia remaining strong. Thank you, Mr. Chancellor!, Mr. Michel! Mrs. Ursula! I thank the European Union, you personally and every EU country for uniting our community in an unprecedented way and gradually providing Europe with even more strength and confidence that freedom in Europe will not yield to any tyranny. This year, Ukraine gained the status of the EU candidate and received the much-needed economic assistance and support with sanctions from Europe. I believe we will continue to cherish this solidarity of values., Dear colleagues! , I am asking you to preserve this level of solidarity for the next year. Russia continues its aggression - and therefore, the support for Ukraine must be continued. Next year just as it was this year. But we must also take long-awaited steps to accelerate the coming of peace. Let me name those steps. There are three of them., The first is a new force., Unfortunately, Russia still has the advantage in artillery and missiles. This is a fact. These capabilities of the occupying army are the ones to fuel the Kremlin's arrogance. But we can overcome this., Ukraine needs modern tanks - and I ask you to provide this defensive capability to us. It can be done right now. , Ukraine needs constant artillery support with guns and shells. It will not allow escalation from the Russian’s side., We need more rocket artillery and more long-range missiles. The more effective we are with such weapons, the shorter the Russian aggression will be., The second is a new resilience., We must maintain financial, energy and social stability next year. Should we not lose in these aspects, we will win in everything else. , The reliable protection of the Ukrainian energy sector from Russian missiles and Iranian drones will be the protection of the whole of Europe, because with these strikes Russia provokes a humanitarian and migration catastrophe not only for Ukraine, but for the whole EU., I call upon you to increase the assistance to Ukraine in the field of gas. The terror against our power plants forced us to use more gas than expected. This is why we need additional support over this particular winter. We are talking about the volume of about two billion cubic meters of gas – that has to be procured additionally., We must be more active with reconstruction. It will clearly demonstrate the true capabilities of the democratic system to the whole world., The third is a new diplomacy., Ukraine has always led the negotiation process and did everything to stop Russian aggression. Now we feel the opportunity to use diplomacy to bring the liberation of all our people and all our territories closer., At the G20 summit in Indonesia, I proposed the Ukrainian Peace Formula - 10 clear points that are quite realistic to implement. For the sake of peace, peace in Ukraine, in Europe, and in the world. You are all aware of those 10 points. I am grateful to you for supporting this initiative., I propose to convene a special summit - Global Peace Formula Summit - to determine how and when we can implement the points of the Ukrainian Peace Formula. I invite you, as well as other conscientious countries, to show your leadership in the implementation of the Peace Formula as a whole or some specific points in particular., I propose Russia to take a concrete and meaningful step towards a diplomatic settlement, which is being mentioned by Moscow so regularly., Very soon we’ll have holidays celebrated by billions of people. Christmas - according to the Gregorian calendar or the New Year and Christmas - according to the Julian calendar. This is the time for normal people to think about peace, not aggression. I suggest Russia to at least try to prove that it is capable of abandoning the aggression. , It would be right to start the withdrawal of Russian troops from the internationally recognized territory of Ukraine this Christmas. If Russia withdraws its troops from Ukraine, it will ensure a lasting cessation of hostilities. , I hope that you will support our call. Because it is in a global interest. This is part of our Peace Formula. The occupier must leave. It will certainly happen. I see no reason why Russia should not do it now – at Christmas. , The answer from Moscow will show what they really want – further confrontation with the world of finally cessation of the aggression. The one who brought the war upon us has to take it away., In any case, no matter what Russia responds, it is we, the free world, who should keep the initiative just as it was throughout this year – since February 24th., I thank you for your attention! I thank Germany for this very effective chairmanship and I believe that Japan's chairmanship will be absolutely effective as well., Thank you once again for your historic support! , Glory to Ukraine!"
11 December 2022  - 22:01 ,We are doing everything so that the aggressor state does not have a single string of Ukrainian society to pull - address of the President,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today we have quite a busy day., I held a meeting of the Staff. The situation on the frontline, the restoration of the energy infrastructure, the intelligence data on the plans of the occupiers, internal challenges. We work everything out in detail., Restoration work continues in the south of our country - we are doing everything to restore the light supply to Odesa. As of this time, we managed to partially restore the supply in Odesa and other cities and districts of the region. We are doing everything to achieve the maximum possible after the Russian hits., But now the Odesa region is still among the regions with the biggest number of shutdowns., Kyiv and the region, Lviv region, Vinnytsia region, Ternopil and the region, Chernivtsi and the region, Zakarpattia, Sumy region, Dnipropetrovsk region - the situation remains very difficult. We are constantly working with partners to mitigate the situation and give our people more opportunities, more electricity., Next week will be important in this regard. The G7 summit, a conference in France on the recovery and resilience of Ukraine in the winter, events at the level of the European Union... We are preparing for participation and expecting important results., I spoke with President Macron today. It was a rather long conversation - more than an hour - and a very meaningful one. Defense, energy, economy, diplomacy... We are coordinating steps, preparing for the implementation of our peace formula - Mr. President Macron supports it, and this is very important for us., Today I also spoke with President of Türkiye Erdoğan. As always, a very specific conversation. About something that is important not only for Ukraine and Türkiye, but what is of truly global importance., We discussed the possibilities of expanding our Black Sea export corridor. I thanked for supporting our “Grain from Ukraine” humanitarian initiative., We agreed on some important joint steps for the near future., Also today - later - a conversation with President of the United States Biden is scheduled. Details and results will be announced after the end of the conversation., And one more thing., By decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, sanctions were applied against seven people. We are doing everything to ensure that the aggressor state does not have a single string of Ukrainian society to pull., Thank you to everyone who protects our country!, Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine!, Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by Russian terrorists!, Glory to Ukraine!"
10 December 2022  - 22:03 ,"Currently there is acute shortage in power system, but our energy and utility crews doing heroic things – address of President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, The key for today is energy. The situation in Odesa region is very difficult. After the night strike by Iranian drones, Odesa and other cities and villages of the region are in the dark. So far, more than 1.5 million people in Odesa are without electricity. Only critical infrastructure is connected and to the extent where it is possible to supply electricity., In total, Russian terrorists used 15 Shahed drones against Odesa. During one night on Saturday. This is the true attitude of Russia towards Odesa, towards Odesa residents – deliberate bullying, deliberate attempt to bring disaster to the city. Our sky defenders managed to shoot down 10 drones out of 15. Well done!, Power engineers, repair crews, regional authorities – everyone is working non-stop to restore power. Unfortunately, the hits were critical, so it takes more than just a period of time to restore electricity... It doesn't take hours, but a few days, unfortunately. We will do everything we can to speed up the recovery., Please, while the repairs are in progress, help your friends, your neighbors, and the elderly in Odesa to find and use the Points of Invincibility. Points of Invincibility are deployed. There you can warm up, charge your equipment, get access to mobile communication, get the necessary, important support., In general, both emergency and stabilization power outages continue in various regions., The power system is now, to put it mildly, very far from a normal state – there is an acute shortage in the system. That is why there are blackout schedules. The largest number is in the Lviv, Vinnytsia, Kyiv, Ternopil, Sumy, Zakarpattia, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytsky regions and in the city of Kyiv., It must be understood: even if there are no heavy missile strikes, this does not mean that there are no problems. Almost every day in different regions there are shelling, there are missile attacks, drone attacks. Energy facilities are hit almost every day. Due to losses in the system, everyone in the system has to reduce the limits. Recovery is also very difficult. But still, our energy and utility crews are doing truly heroic things, restoring in weeks what would have required months of work. And I thank each who is working to restore power and save the power system., I also thank everyone who realizes how hard it is for our defenders of the sky, how hard it is for the repair crews and very hard for the energy workers, how hard it is for everyone who protects our lives., Today, we have important news from Norway. There is a new support package from this country in the amount of $100 million. And precisely for the restoration of our energy system after these Russian strikes. I thank all Norwegians for this decision. I'm thankful to the government. In general, we receive defense, economic and very important political support from Norway, as well as a lot of humanitarian assistance. Norway also helps with the purchase of gas. We will work together on the reconstruction of Ukraine. I want to thank you once again., Today, in the Norwegian capital, Oslo, the annual ceremony of awarding the Nobel Peace Prize took place. This year, the language of Ukraine, our Ukrainian language, was heard for the first time at the ceremony – thanks to the Center for Civil Liberties and its head Mrs. Matviichuk, who became laureates of the Peace Prize. I congratulate Ms. Oleksandra, her colleagues and all Ukrainian human rights defenders on this recognition., It is symbolic that the ceremony takes place on this very day – International Human Rights Day. In Ukraine, before there was no national day of gratitude and respect for the human rights movement – all those who dedicate their lives to the protection and restoration of people's rights. Now such a day has been established and will be celebrated annually on December 10 – Human Rights Day., Earlier, I signed several more important decrees. In particular, about awarding state scholarships., And Mr. Edem Bekirov was awarded the state scholarship named after Levko Lukyanenko. This is a special scholarship with which the state supports those who were released from the captivity of the occupiers, who were saved from Russian repression., Outstanding figures of our science, culture, and art have been awarded other state scholarships. A total of 100 Ukrainian men and women., I thank everyone who works for our country!, Glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine and thanks to whom we can live and work!, Eternal memory to all those who died for our freedom!, Glory to Ukraine!"
9 December 2022  - 20:04 ,To involve the world in the implementation of the peace formula is now one of the key tasks for Ukraine – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, I had an important conversation with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak today. We coordinated our positions ahead of the summit next week. In fact, this will be the final G7 summit this year, and it will determine the priorities for the next year. We are preparing as many as possible solutions that our countries need – for Ukraine and for the G7 states., I also thanked Mr. Prime Minister and the entire United Kingdom for the constant support of our state. They discussed the situation on the front line and winter prospects on the battlefield., The front-line situation remains very difficult in the key areas of Donbas – Bakhmut, Soledar, Maryinka, Kreminna... For a long time, there is no living place left on the land of these areas that has not been damaged by shells and fire. The occupiers actually destroyed Bakhmut, another Donbas city that the Russian army turned into burnt ruins., I thank all our heroes, all soldiers and commanders who hold the front in these directions, repulse attacks and inflict significant losses on the enemy in response to the hell that entered Ukraine under the Russian flag., Today, a conference was held in Kyiv, which continued the line of events in our country and in Europe that took place this week and last week, during which we work out solutions for the sake of justice, for the sake of holding Russia accountable, and for the sake of finding formats for the release of our people, who are held captive by the occupiers., We feel support from both states and international organizations and human rights institutions. We hope to be able to announce specific details in the near future., By the way, the results of the visit of the First Lady of Ukraine to London and her speech in the British Parliament were discussed with the British Prime Minister. On behalf of our country, Olena proposed that the United Kingdom shows leadership in the issue of justice – in the creation of a special tribunal to try the crime of Russian aggression. This is one of the points of the Ukrainian peace formula, and it is very important for me to see now in international communication that global leaders have really heard Ukrainian peace proposals., Let me remind you that the peace formula consists of ten points – from nuclear security to the restoration of the territorial integrity of our state, from energy security to the return of all prisoners of war and deportees held on the territory of Russia. This is now one of the key tasks for our state – to involve the world in concrete implementation of the points of the peace formula. We must return the Ukrainian flag to all cities and communities of Ukraine, we must ensure the real responsibility of the terrorist state for this war, and we must guarantee the safety of all generations of Ukrainians after the end of this war., Every day of the heroic resistance of our Defense Forces and all our people brings closer the day when the entire Ukraine will finally experience victory, victory and peace. Real, reliable., Today, I presented the Ukrainian vision of steps towards peace at the TRT World Forum in Istanbul. There I focused on food security – on Ukrainian initiatives that add global weight to our state. This is the grain export initiative and the Grain from Ukraine initiative., Using these transparent and useful examples for our people, for the Black Sea region and for the entire global community, we show that it is quite possible to restore security. The main thing is determination. I am sure that Mr. President Erdoğan, who was at the forum, heard our position., We are already preparing for a very important next week – there will be important international events. I held relevant meetings today. I believe: there will be powerful decisions for our country., Glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine!, Thanks to everyone who works for our people!, Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for independence!, Glory to Ukraine!"
9 December 2022  - 15:26 ,"There must be a single legal front that will overcome Russia's genocidal policy - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's speech at ""UA: Human Rights in Dark Times"" International Conference in Kyiv",", Ladies and Gentlemen!, Dear colleagues!, Dear attendees, guests!, Dear journalists!, It is good that today there is a format of such an important Conference, exactly today - on International Day of Commemoration and Dignity of the Victims of the Crime of Genocide and of the Prevention of this Crime and on the eve of Human Rights Day., On December 9, 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. And the next day, on December 10, 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights., In 74 years, the norms of these and many other similar documents have united the world community. More than 150 countries have become parties to the Genocide Convention. More than 190 countries have endorsed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights., But is the world really united around the ideas that were the basis of these documents? As a matter of fact, there was no such unification around ideas, around values. We felt it after the beginning of the Russian war against people, humanity, against our state. Against all living things., We felt that many things that should work and protect against such a genocidal policy existed rather as, pardon, a formality. As a legacy from the old days that was simply dusted off when it was time for the annual celebrations., But now we are changing that. Together with everyone who today helps us, Ukraine and Ukrainians. And we are changing that not only for ourselves. This is a very important point. Again - for people, for humanity, for life., Every time we unite the world to protect Ukraine, to protect Ukrainians, every time we achieve decisions on the implementation of fundamental international norms, every time we manage to fill international institutions and rules with real power and energy, we achieve results - for Ukrainians and great results for the whole world. For everyone who may be threatened by this or that form of aggression. This or that manifestation of genocidal policy. This or that strike of terror., Defending ourselves against Russia now, we are turning the words of many conventions and declarations into concrete actions for the sake of people and, again, for the sake of humanity., By saving Ukrainians from Russia, we give hope to many other people, many other communities, other nations who feel that the same aggression could be launched against them., Working to bring the Russian Federation to just responsibility for aggression, for war crimes, for acts of its genocidal policy, we are creating mechanisms for the implementation of the norms of international law, which will actually serve to prevent international crimes and establish justice for decades after the end of this war, after our victory - the victory of Ukraine and the world., Ladies and Gentlemen!, That is why we need the broadest possible cooperation. Both in our society and at the international level., The crimes of the Russian state on the territory of Ukraine and specifically against Ukrainians are unprecedented since World War II. Ukrainian cities, our towns, our villages, which the Russian artillery simply crashes into stones... Not one, not two - but dozens of such destroyed cities and villages., Aviation and missile terror, strikes by the Russian Federation, which are so reminiscent of the Nazi bombing of Britain and London. Of all the missiles launched by the Russian army since February 24, 62% were directed specifically against civilian objects, against people, against humanity., And there are also filtration camps. Real, modern torture chambers and mass burials of people were revealed. Forced deportation of Ukrainians to Russia - more than 2 million people were deported. Illegal adoption by Russian families of our Ukrainian children who were actually kidnapped from Ukraine. Criminal mobilization of Ukrainian citizens in the occupied territories into the occupation army. Mine terror against Ukrainians. Constant shelling, victims in the border area with the Russian Federation and in the frontline areas..., All this is such a terrible scale of crimes committed and the destinies and lives of people destroyed. All this is a tragedy of such magnitude., To restore justice, our state needs the maximum possible cooperation of everyone - cooperation with the human rights community, with all international partners. There must be a single legal front that will overcome Russia's genocidal policy., And that is why, addressing you and every day, I call on all government officials and all representatives of civil society who care about people, who care about humanity, representatives of various organizations, representatives of international human rights organizations, agencies to work now in a coordinated manner, together at all levels, together - for the sake of restoring the rights of people violated by the war, the rights of Ukrainians and for bringing the aggressor to justice, mandatory and fair. We have to find such a formula for cooperation, so that there is a maximum result for our state and for the international legal order., And I am glad that Chris Field is present among us today - it’s my pleasure, good afternoon - President of the International Ombudsman Institute, a representative of a system whose potential can provide much more for the protection of human rights for Ukraine., Let me explain what I mean. For example, the Ukrainian Ombudsman, Mr. Dmytro Lubinets, is now very actively involved in the work of our joint team - Budanov, Yermak, Malyuk - regarding the release of our prisoners of war, the release of our civilians held captive in Russia or in temporarily occupied territories. We have already managed to return 1,331 Ukrainian warriors. And I am very proud of this result of our country. Protecting people wherever they are - we have to bring everyone back. This is our duty., And at a time when, to put it mildly, we do not see determination and concrete actions in the relevant processes from such organizations as the International Committee of the Red Cross, we have to search and find new people in new realities, new formats of interaction, new lines of cooperation. Perhaps this system - the system of ombudsmen and the international component of cooperation in this system will be able to bring us closer to the result we strive for - the return home of all Ukrainians: adults, children, prisoners of war, political prisoners - all those forcibly detained in the territory of the Russian Federation and temporarily occupied territories of our country. It's worth at least a try. I think so. We have to try to make efforts every day, because all these are steps forward to victory., Until recently, many did not believe that the ratification of one of the fundamental documents for the protection of human rights and equality of all communities, the Istanbul Convention, was possible in Ukraine. Now it is a reality in Ukraine - the convention has been ratified., Until recently, many people said that Ukraine would allegedly not be able to obtain the status of a candidate for joining the European Union. Now it is a reality. We have become closer to European institutions. I am also proud of it. I am proud of all the people who worked for such results., Until recently, talks dominated Europe that the European Union would allegedly not be able to really unite to protect our common interests, common values, our people... Until recently, skepticism about UN structures was spreading in the world. Today, we see that the European Union is capable of being truly strong and united. And the power of the UN can be directed to solve real problems - we are talking about global problems, such as the food crisis. This is what happens when we take up the cause together, when our state, Ukraine, takes up the cause., We must always keep faith in ourselves and our partners. We must be absolutely determined, principled, we must be open to cooperation with everyone who also values determination and principles. This is how we will get all the results we so desperately need for Ukraine, for Europe, and for humanity., A Special Tribunal for the crime of aggression by the Russian Federation against the state of Ukraine must be established. And I call on all of you to do everything so that the maximum majority in the UN General Assembly supports the corresponding draft resolution in order to establish this desired and necessary justice., A compensation mechanism must also be launched to provide compensation for all losses at the expense of the assets of the aggressor, at the expense of the Russian Federation, for all those who suffered from this war of Russia against Ukraine. The relevant resolution is endorsed by the UN General Assembly, and I ask everyone to contribute to its maximum implementation., All Russian murderers, all those who organized and implemented this genocidal policy and terror must be brought to justice. For this purpose, I urge you to cooperate with the Office of the Prosecutor General, Ukrainian law enforcement agencies, with our partners who are investigating the crimes of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, and with the International Criminal Court., I am sure that together we will implement absolutely all of this - we will ensure justice for Ukraine, for each and every one., I thank everyone who works for the sake of Ukrainians! For the sake of life., Glory to all our heroic strong warriors!, Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by Russian terror!, Glory to Ukraine!, Thank you."
9 December 2022  - 13:03 ,Guaranteeing the security of the Mykolaiv region and its ports will be the next step towards ensuring global food security - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the TRT World Forum 2022 in Istanbul,", Mr. President Erdoğan!, Mr. Prime Minister Rama!, Dear friends!, Thank you for your attention to Ukraine and now I would like to address the entire audience gathered by this Forum. A powerful audience. Powerful is not a random word now, it is a key word., A word that reflects our capabilities - of Ukraine, Türkiye, the Black Sea region. Capabilities right now - and in the future years and decades., The Russian war against Ukraine showed the value of stability in our region. This is one of the historical mistakes of the Russian leader - with his insane aggression, he only proved that the security of Ukraine and the Black Sea region is critically important for global security, and any aggression in our part of the world is a global crime., The food crisis that the world has experienced this year and that we are overcoming together with Türkiye and the UN fully illustrates what I am talking about., There would not be any severity of the food crisis if the Russian fleet had not blocked our ports in the Black Sea. Without the export of our food, the global market is instantly destabilized. This was felt by various countries in Africa and Asia, and this was manifested in food price fluctuations in other parts of the planet., But thanks to our brave warriors who are changing the balance of power in the confrontation with Russia and thanks to the power of diplomacy, we managed to resume sea exports from the three Black Sea ports of Ukraine. Since July of this year, we have already exported more than 13 million tons of agricultural products to 40 countries around the world. The global market felt it. In the end, it was also reflected in social stability in the respective countries consuming our food., That’s what our power is. Ukraine, Türkiye, the UN - together they are preventing the threat of famine, which so much has been said about. When we jointly take care of the security of our region, of normal life in our region, it provides, as a result, elements of global security. It provides the elements of peace that all conscientious states need., Recently, at the G19 summit in Indonesia, I presented the Ukrainian Peace Formula. A formula that can put an end to Russian aggression and restore the force of international law for Ukraine and all other nations., Food security is one of the elements of our Peace Formula. And this is something where the leadership role of Türkiye can manifest itself one hundred percent. If we manage not only to maintain the current level of agricultural exports from Ukraine and our humanitarian initiative - ""Grain From Ukraine"" - which helps the poorest countries maintain stability, but also to restore the full-fledged export of Ukrainian food in the volume that the world needs., Now there are more than 13 million tons of agricultural products for export. And we can ensure tens of millions of tons more., Our ports involved in the grain export initiative are operating at half capacity only. And this is only because Russia slows down the implementation of exports - it keeps ships waiting for ""inspections""., As of today, more than 80 ships are waiting. And this is not just something about trade. This means that hundreds of thousands of people have less food on their tables. This means that hundreds of thousands of people overpay for food. Why? Only because one state blackmails everyone with food., The average waiting period for ships is 3-5 weeks. Because of this, 2-3 million tons of Ukrainian agricultural products are under-exported every month. Does our region have the potential to solve this? It definitely has., And if we manage to eliminate several more vectors of Russian aggression against Ukraine and guarantee the safety of our Mykolaiv region, in particular the ports of the region, this will be another step towards a more complete guarantee of global food security. Is there potential for this in the Black Sea region? There is, too. This could be a move by Türkiye - a diplomatic move., Ladies and Gentlemen!, The fact that we manage to implement such initiatives as the grain export initiative and the ""Grain from Ukraine"" humanitarian initiative gives us a format for implementing other similar initiatives, other points of the Ukrainian Peace Formula., The main thing is leadership. The main thing is not just to know about your power, not just to demonstrate it occasionally, but to direct its potential for the sake of peace., The Ukrainian Peace Formula is formulated in such a way that its points allow each state and each leader to choose the aspect in which the determination of this particular state and this leader can work., I suggest that all our partners choose points for themselves - so that the entire peace formula is implemented. So that step by step - as with grain initiatives - we achieve the security architecture we need., Guarantee radiation and nuclear security. Guarantee food security. Guarantee energy security, stop insane Russian missile terror. Guarantee the release of all prisoners, the return of all deportees. By the way, Türkiye and President Erdoğan have already helped us significantly with this point - we are grateful for that., The next point of our Peace Formula is to guarantee the implementation of the UN Charter and the restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Guarantee the withdrawal of Russian troops from the occupied land and thereby stop hostilities. Guarantee justice - by punishing those guilty of terror and compensating for damages. Guarantee effective countermeasures against ecocide and save the Black Sea region from environmental disasters that may become a repercussion of the Russian war. Guarantee the prevention of any escalation and the durability of peace after dismantling all elements of Russian aggression., The Ukrainian Peace Formula is clear. Does it look unrealistic? Not at all. It looks now just as the idea of ​​renewing grain exports from our seaports looked in May of this year. , Already in July, exports resumed - thanks to our joint power., Let this power work in everything else that is needed for peace!, Thank you, Türkiye, for your support!, Thank you, Mr. President!, Glory to Ukraine!"
9 December 2022  - 11:10 ,The spirit of Ukraine is the spirit of freedom that echoes in the souls of people around the world - President's speech at the Time event dedicated to the announcement of remarkable people and events of 2022,", Ladies and Gentlemen! , It is an honor for me – to represent the struggle of Ukrainians and the Spirit of Ukraine., The spirit of freedom, that echoes in the souls of so many people around the world... , Stories of heroes, who are fighting for independence, are also – your stories., Ordinary men and women who became brave-hearts, when they joined the Defence Forces to defend freedom, – different generations of different nations knew this spirit., Doctors, who save the wounded under bombs, during blackouts or in occupation – no matter what it takes. It is about humanness, that we all value so dearly., Farmers, who work the land under the roaring guns. It is about natural desire to live and take care of one’s families and communities., Journalists, who spread the truth – it is in the history of how to resist tyrants. The history, which began even before the word “journalism” appeared., This is what inspires across all continents – freedom fighters, who may possess nothing, but courage to defeat those with armored vehicles and repression experience. When freedom wins and tyranny collapses, people are smiling the same way all over the globe., Lawyers, who do not yet see the upcoming victory in war, but are already working to ensure that war criminals are brought to justice, – this is the Nuremberg Trials story with many other just verdicts, that were delivered to those, who believed in their impunity., This is the spirit! You have already seen the spirit of Ukraine on the covers of Time Magazine – not on each one, but on many. They were not Ukrainians – on the covers before, but they were – courage, striving for freedom, solidarity, creativity and dedication, – values well known to the mankind from a long time ago and which united the world this year with the colors of the Ukrainian national flag and our people’s achievements. , This is the free world spirit. And let's do everything for our spirit to win!, I thank you for your attention!, Thank you for supporting Ukraine!, Слава Україні!"
8 December 2022  - 22:17 ,I am sure that mine terror will be among the charges against Russia for aggression - address by the President of Ukraine,", Fellow Ukrainians!, I have just signed the decrees on awarding posthumously the policemen whose lives were taken yesterday in the Kherson region by Russian mines., The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to police colonel Mykhailo Kuratchenko. Orders ""For Courage"" - to police captains Ihor Melnyk and Serhiy Nenada and police corporal Vadym Perizhko., Once again, my condolences…, They did everything for the safety of Ukrainians. Already returning after completing one of the tasks, when they removed weapons and ammunition from the cache of the occupiers, many of which were left in the Kherson region, the policemen stumbled upon a mine trap., And this is the form of Russian terror that will have to be countered for years to come. Terrorists deliberately try to leave behind as many death traps as possible. Buried landmines, tripwire mines, mined buildings, cars and infrastructure... This is more than 170 thousand square kilometers of dangerous territory., I am sure: this will be among the charges against Russia for aggression - precisely mine terror. Which is even more cruel and meaner than a missile one, because there is no anti-mine system that could destroy at least part of the threat, as our air defense does., I am grateful to all our partners who help Ukraine with demining. Canada, Japan, Great Britain, Slovakia, ambassadors and donors of United24 and many others who understand how important it is that Ukraine is not left alone with the problem of the territory mined by the occupiers., I met today with representatives of Slovakia, the government delegation - ministers of foreign affairs, defense and economy. We discussed the existing cooperation between our states both at the bilateral level and in the structures of the European Union. We agreed on new solutions for the sake of our common security and political interests., We are actively working to support and strengthen the next sanctions against Russia – by European, American and other partners. The issue of the ninth EU sanctions package is currently in progress., We are also waiting for other decisions, in particular, regarding schemes for circumventing anti-war sanctions, including financial and energy ones., We are preparing several important events - for tomorrow and next week. Protecting and restoring the rights of our people, rebuilding Ukraine are constant priorities. The next week will be quite important for Ukraine in terms of these two tasks., I thank all those who fight for freedom!, I thank everyone who strengthens our state and helps our people!, Eternal memory to everyone who gave their lives for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
8 December 2022  - 12:14 ,It is an honor for me to represent all Ukrainians - President's speech at the annual announcement of the list of the most influential people in Europe Politico 28,", Ladies and Gentlemen!, I thank you for this award to the Ukrainian people. And I mean it – it is destined to all Ukrainians. Because leaders can be truly influential only when they represent not only themselves, but the common will, common dream, common goal of their people. , This is how we live in Ukraine. , We are as united as possible – and that is why we are that strong. We are focused on protecting our independence – and that is why we are achieving our goals. We have faced the threat of losing everything – and that is why we have found the strength to become number one., The Ukrainian military, who protect us all on the battlefields, are number one. Maryinka, Avdiivka, Bakhmut, Soledar, Kreminna – please remember these names... that is where freedom is now being fought for. For all of us in Europe. In hard battles and at the cost of many lives., Ukrainian businessmen who, despite the total war, supply everything necessary for the life of the country, protect jobs and pay taxes, are number one. And I thank all our friends in Europe who help us maintain stability., Ukrainian doctors, energy workers, sappers, volunteers, drivers and builders, defense workers, teachers, policemen, diplomats... Hundreds of thousands of those who help millions live through this terrible time – they are number one., And it is an honor for me to represent all these people. All Ukrainians. And guide our common will for our common dream. For the sake of a common goal... For the sake of Ukraine's victory in this war. For the sake of rebuilding Ukraine. For the full accession of Ukraine to the community of European nations – to our European Union., I believe that Ukrainians will be the most influential next year as well. But – already in peacetime., Thanks to everyone who supports us! , Thank you, Politico, for being always unbiased! , Слава Україні!"
7 December 2022  - 22:48 ,Russia will be held to account for all stolen assets of the Ukrainian state and companies - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today was a long and hard day., The Kherson region - four policemen died during stabilization measures... Russian mines., Among the dead was Mykhailo Kuratchenko, chief of police of the Cherkasy region. He was helping colleagues in the south. EOD technician Ihor Melnyk. Dog trainer Serhiy Nenada. Assistant duty officer of the Uman district police department Vadym Perizhok. Doctors are currently saving the lives of four more policemen., Police forces along with all the defense forces of our state are now on the frontline. And together with everyone they protect Ukrainians, together with everyone they suffer losses... My condolences., The Donetsk region - today the Russian army carried out a very brutal, absolutely deliberate strike at Kurakhove. Precisely at civilians. At ordinary people. At the market, elevator, gas station, bus station, residential building. The list of the dead so far includes ten people, there are many wounded., My condolences to relatives and friends... Eternal memory to all victims of Russian terror!, I’ve held a meeting of the Staff today. Commanders' reports, analysis of the situation in specific directions., First of all, regarding the Donetsk region, Bakhmut districts and other hottest spots. A very fierce confrontation is ongoing there, every meter counts. , I thank all our guys who destroy the enemy right there - every day, every night, every hour. , Of course, due attention was paid to the Luhansk region and Kharkiv region at the Staff’s meeting, there were reports on the situation in general and on the borders., Energy sector is a permanent item on our agenda - both at the Staff and government levels. , I’ve also held a meeting on the stabilization of the energy system and the protection of our power plants. , We are constantly increasing the generation and supply of electricity - we are adding more volume almost every day. But we should not forget - and everyone should not forget - that it is now impossible to restore 100% of the energy system as it was before the beginning of the Russian energy terror. We need time. That is why shutdown schedules remain in most cities and districts., As of this evening, the biggest number of shutdowns is in Kyiv and the region, Lviv region, Zhytomyr region, Khmelnytskyi region, Poltava region, Vinnytsia region and Zakarpattia. And I thank all our energy workers, repairmen, businesses, utility workers and local authorities who are doing everything they can to make things easier for people., By the way, today is the Day of Local Self-Government. This is a holiday for all those who work with people directly and on whom almost everything in communities depends., As in any government, in local self-government there are different people of different personal qualities and views. And today I thank all those who, at their level, really protect their communities. Who can be trusted and to whom people come for help. Who really takes care of the defense - within their responsibility - and who prepares everything so that his or her community can get through this winter more easily., Thank you and congratulations on your professional day., Today we have a very important result in France. The Supreme Court of France upheld the decision on recovery in favor of the Ukrainian Oschadbank from the aggressor state. The amount with accrued interest is almost 1.5 billion dollars., This legal process has been dragging since 2015. More than six years of struggle, tens of thousands of pages of legal documents, many hopes and no less skepticism expressed by some... But there is this victory for Ukraine. Russia will be held to account for all stolen assets of the Ukrainian state and companies., This is the first victory for a state-owned company in the legal cases against Russia concerning the seized property in Crimea, and I thank each and every one who secured this result., Today, representatives of the Office and the government took part in a conference in America - a conference dedicated to the creation of a special tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine., Similarly, not everyone in the world agrees now that this tribunal will work. But no matter what they say, we will do our part and will definitely achieve a result for Ukraine and Ukrainians., We are already preparing for the events of the second half of the week - at the international level. There will be important decisions for our defense., We do everything to make them stronger., I am grateful to all partners of our country!, Glory to all who work for the victory!, Glory to each of our warriors - to all those who obtain life for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
7 December 2022  - 20:50 ,The fate of millions of people who can be saved is being decided on the battlefield in Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Foundation,", Ladies and Gentlemen!, I greet you from Ukraine and thank you for supporting our fight for freedom!, I want you to know what this support means. What American aid means to our defense against Russian terror., This is an opportunity for every Ukrainian to feel that freedom will reign on our land, and not the brutality of the occupier. This is an opportunity for every Ukrainian father and mother to be sure that child will choose his or her own path in life, and it will be a free life, not an endless fear of dictatorship. When we ask for support, it is always a request from people to people., On February 24, Russia started a total war against us, and this is a war for survival. Hundreds of our cities and villages were simply burned to the ground by Russian strikes., We have already managed to free from occupation one thousand eight hundred and eighty eight settlements. But almost as many Ukrainian towns and villages remain under occupation. And this means that now the fate of millions of people is being decided on the battlefield in Ukraine. Millions – who can be saved., We have no right to leave even a single Ukrainian under the Russian occupation! Not in Russian filtration camps, where thousands have already disappeared. And not on Russian territory, where hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians were forcibly deported... We can free them. This is our hope. This is what your support means. This is not about politics, this is about life., I will repeat these words once again – this is not about politics, this is about life., Isn't that what real democracy is all about?, There are always moments when it is necessary to say: this is not about politics, this is about life. There are always times when you need to support – because support means much more than just giving or doing something., Now is that very time – when support literally means saving, saving millions of people, millions of fathers and mothers, millions of children., And I am grateful to you for being with us – for the fact that the United States of America really support Ukraine. I believe that thanks to your support in particular, we will be able to say one day that all Ukraine is finally free and safe from Russian terror., Thank you for your attention!, Thank you for the ripple of hope that we raised together this year!, Слава Україні!"
7 December 2022  - 11:37 ,Whoever started an unprovoked and criminal war must lose and bear responsibility - speech by the President of Ukraine at the Madeleine K. Albright Democracy Awards ceremony,", Dear friends!, As I record this address, our 286th day of defense in full-scale war is ending. , And this is not just an ordinary day – it is a holiday of our Armed Forces. A day celebrated by millions of Ukrainians – on their land, in their state, under their flag., Just feel it – the 286th day of a full-scale war against an aggressor that many in the world thought was invincible… And we celebrate the Day of OUR Armed Forces, not a sort of some kind a day of the occupiers., On February 23 of this year, a day before the escalation of the Russian war, madame Madeleine Albright published an opinion editorial that the Russian leader was making a historic mistake. These were prophetic words., He really made a mistake – the biggest in his life and the lives of modern generations of Russians., But, friends, we all know that the ""haunted idea"" of any dictatorship is to ignore mistakes and pretend that there were no mistakes, especially when it comes to the first-person error of the dictatorship., This is exactly how Russia is behaving now. , Obviously, the dictator lost. But he is doing everything to ensure that Russia continues to fight if only to avoid admitting to himself and others that a historical mistake has been made. If Russia feels backed into a corner, it has only itself to blame., Ukraine and the free world should definitely not change their goals and exchange their values for some compromises, if the dictatorship is afraid to admit a mistake and tempts with a break in the battles. We must fully protect freedom and guarantee the security of our democracy., Whoever started an unprovoked and criminal war must lose and bear responsibility. Ukraine and the world must receive guarantees of peace, stability and security., Celebrating today the Day of our Armed Forces we feel we can provide this. And therefore, we must! Apart from the Ukrainian victory, any other option will be a mistake, and this must be honestly admitted., That is why we need to continue to have the same strong American leadership that we have seen during these 286 days and always. I believe that it will be so., Thank you for your attention! Thank you for this honorable title! And thank you to every American for always helping those who fight for freedom! , God Bless America!, God Bless Ukraine!, Слава Україні!"
6 December 2022  - 22:56 ,"Now our people will celebrate the Day of the Ukrainian Armed Forces with words of gratitude, feelings of gratitude, tears of gratitude - address by the President of Ukraine",", Glory to Ukraine!, Gentlemen, generals, officers, sergeants, soldiers!, Fellow Ukrainians!, Dear attendees!, Today is the day of our gratitude. This is exactly the meaning of December 6 - and it is forever. Now, this is the only way our people will celebrate the Day of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - with words of gratitude, feelings of gratitude, tears of gratitude., I am sure, millions of times today ""thank you"" was said or simply thought in Ukraine., I am thankful to the warriors of our army and all formations of the defense forces of Ukraine., I am thankful to the parents of our warriors who raised real winners. That's that - winners., I am thankful to all the doctors and nurses who save the wounded heroes., I am thankful to everyone who strengthens the defense and provides Ukrainian warriors with everything they need., When the Day of the Armed Forces in a state is a holiday of gratitude, I am sure that such a state cannot be defeated and cannot be broken. And today we all see it for sure and have seen it again., Dear attendees!, For 8 years and 286 days, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been defending our beautiful state from the occupier, from Russian aggression. Thousands of Ukrainians gave their lives for the day to come when not a single occupier remains on our land and all our people are free again., I ask you now to honor with a moment of silence the memory of everyone who died on the battlefield for the sake of our state, for the sake of Ukraine, and whose life became part of the heroic history of courage of Ukraine., Fellow Ukrainians!, Today it is an honor for me to spend the whole day together with our defenders. In the morning, I was in the Donetsk region - I thanked the fighters who defend our state in the most dangerous and responsible directions. Those who are fighting in Svatove, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and other directions in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. I presented state awards and decorations to the warriors., I was in the Kharkiv region today - I thanked the doctors who save our indomitable fighters. In the Kharkiv region, I presented awards to the fighters who participated in the liberation of the region and who continue to expel the occupiers from Ukraine., Today we managed to bring home another 60 warriors who were in Russian captivity. We will continue to return our people and free everyone., Now here, in the Mariyinsky Palace, are our heroes, relatives of our warriors, commanders and representatives of combat brigades and units who have just arrived from the front and are returning to the frontline again. Where it's really hot. Where they really fight for our freedom, for our independence, for our children., And I want to say to everyone present what is definitely in the heart of every Ukrainian today: I thank you! I thank absolutely all soldiers, all sailors, all sergeants, sergeant-majors, all officers, all heroes, generals and, of course, all your fathers and mothers, our dear, esteemed Ukrainian warriors., I wish you all one thing - victory! To all of us. You deserve it! All our people deserve it. All our parents, our children deserve it. Our state and history deserve it. To finally gain victory., Glory to the Armed Forces of Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
5 December 2022  - 20:56 ,"When a terrorist destabilizes everyone's lives, stopping terror is a joint task - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, A report on the day., The main result - 70 Russian missiles were launched, most of them were shot down. Kalibr, Kh-101, etc., I am grateful to all our warriors of the air commands ""East"", ""South"" and ""Center"". Well done!, I am also grateful to our partners for the air defense systems we are currently using. Every downed Russian missile is concrete proof that terror can be defeated., But, unfortunately, we still cannot ensure complete security to our sky - there were several hits., Unfortunately, there are victims. As of this time, there are four people killed by Russian strikes today. My condolences to families and friends., Energy workers immediately started restoration. Maximum efforts are in the central regions of Ukraine, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv regions. In many regions we had to switch to emergency shutdowns to stabilize the system. From Zakarpattia to Kyiv region, from Kirovohrad region to Sumy and Kharkiv regions. As of this evening, the biggest number of shutdowns is in Vinnytsia, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, Khmelnytskyi and Cherkasy regions. But we will do everything to restore stability., Russian terror again affects neighboring states. There are interruptions with electricity supply in Moldova again. And this once again proves that Russia's ability to carry out such massive terrorist attacks is a threat not only to Ukraine, but also to our entire region. At least., When one terrorist destabilizes everyone's lives, stopping terror is a joint task., Tonight I will talk about this in my address to the expert community of the American Institute for the Study of War and to all our friends in the United States., By the way, with today’s missile attack Russia marked the anniversary of the Budapest Memorandum. The fate of this document gives answers to many current questions about Russia. Simply signing something with these terrorists will not bring peace. They will certainly break any agreements reached with them. Giving up any element of someone else’s security to Russia means new war., Therefore a principled continuation of the existing policy of conscientious states of the world is necessary: it is only the dismantling of Russian terrorist capacities, liberation of all our territories and holding the murderers to account that will bring peace. I believe we will come to this., Another result of today is a new declaration of support for Ukraine's Euro-Atlantic course. This is the third such declaration. Today it was signed with Montenegro. After the Czech Republic and Belgium., We will complete this path step by step - we will persuade the Euro-Atlantic majority in favor of Ukraine. And not just in words, but in decisions. In decisions to support our accession to the collective security system., And one more thing, Finally, a special award for extraordinary people appeared in Ukraine - for Ukrainian volunteers. ""Gold Heart"". Today, greeting the volunteer community, I named the first 50 teams and individuals who will receive this new award shortly. But this is far from a complete list of those who deserve it., The state should know how to be grateful and express gratitude. And it will., Glory to everyone who defends Ukraine!, Gratitude to everyone who helps our state hold out against Russian terror!, Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by terrorists!, Glory to Ukraine!"
5 December 2022  - 17:12 ,Volunteers are the most powerful part of the civil society of Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the International Volunteer Day,", Fellow Ukrainians!, Today is International Volunteer Day. International, yet so Ukrainian., This is the day of millions of our people. Not hundreds, not thousands, but millions. This is the day of everyone who helps defend the state. Everyone who helps protect the people. All those who give their soul, time, and money for Ukraine and Ukrainians to succeed. To win., The volunteer movement in our country rose in waves from Maidan, from 2014 and from February 24. The waves that were getting higher and stronger., Today, volunteers are the most powerful part of Ukrainian civil society. This is a movement that unites all cities and communities of our country and all social groups., And this is an idea that attracts millions of people from different countries of the world to the Ukrainian struggle for freedom., Today is the day of very famous organizations, whose names every Ukrainian has heard, and the day of people whose names do not yet sound throughout the country, but who, together with everyone, will feel that this is their result on the day of our victory., This is the day of Veteran Hub and Army SOS, “Zgraya” and “Aerorozvidka”, KSE Foundation and those who founded and help “Nebesna Gvardiya” project., The day of ""Hospitallers"" and all paramedics and doctors who help at the front. This is the day of ""Kryla Peremogy"" and NGO ""Zemliachky"", “Povernys Zhyvym"" and ""Motohelp"" foundations, Serhiy Prytula Foundation and the Volunteer Hundred of Dobrovolia, ""Kolo"" and ""Solomyanski Kotyky"" foundations, the Marlog Center and the Ukrainian Volunteer Service, Razom for Ukraine, ""Narodny Tyl"" association, Help Army volunteer group and the Ukrainian Red Cross Society. This is the day of United24 and each of the more than a hundred countries who help us buy ambulances or naval drones. This is the day of star ambassadors who have also become volunteers and direct the power of the world for Ukraine., Today is the day of Kharkiv “Pidtrymka Zakhysnykiv” Foundation and Lviv NGO “Nezalezhni”, the day of the Union of Ukrainian Women from the Ivano-Frankivsk region and the Kramatorsk Center “Razom do Peremohy”, “Angely Spasinnia” Foundation from the Donetsk region and NGO “Miskyi Tsentr Dopomohy” from Zaporizhzhia., This is the day of SpivDiia and PLAST, NGO ""Ridne Polissia"", the Active Rehabilitation Group, the Ukrainian Women's Battalion, ""Kotyky-Patriotyky"" and ""Dobra Sprava"", Let's help, ""Kharkiv z Toboyu"" foundations, HopeUA, ""Tvoya Opora"", ""My z Ukrainoyu"" and ""Rayon Nomer 1""., And also the day of Yevhen Subota, coordinator of volunteer centers in Hostomel. Ulyana Hredil from NGO ""Apostolska Chota"". NGO ""Zakhyst - Obyednannia Volonteriv"". Yulia Konovalova, head of NGO ""Liudy Usiudy"" and volunteer of the World Central Kitchen project. Volodymyr Firman, rector of Zarvanytsia Marian Spiritual Centre., This is the day of the Ukrainian Catholic University and dozens of universities and student communities in our country and abroad, which have joined the defense of our state, freedom and people. And humanity., That's why today we thank organizations like Zoopatrol and UAnimals, and everyone who knows that saving animals is also saving souls., You probably know most of these names, you may have already helped some of these organizations and projects. But the volunteer movement is much larger and broader. These are thousands of structures, tens of thousands of people who care and millions of those who join., This is the day of those who were looking for bulletproof vests on Maidan and continued to look for and deliver everything that might be necessary for the frontline., This is the day of those who make camouflage nets: Lviv, Rivne and thousands of other Ukrainian cities and villages, tens of thousands of people., This is the day of ordinary Ukrainians who help us all solve very difficult tasks. They help restore the energy sector after strikes. Return normal life to the de-occupied territory., This is the day of those who provide rehabilitation and prosthetics. Who provide psychological help. Who support displaced persons. Who help those released from captivity. Who bake bread for the military and deliver food to the most dangerous places., This is the day of the drivers who helped with the evacuation and the delivery of the humanitarian aid. This is the day of many different people who all together strengthen Ukraine., This is the day of thousands of Ukrainian businesses that made their projects to help the army and ordinary people or joined existing volunteer programs. And the day of businessmen who do everything to strengthen Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, not Monaco and Vienna., Although the volunteer movement has become part of the foundation of Ukraine, we did not have a special award that could become a symbol of our gratitude to volunteers and those who give strength to this movement. Who give a part of their own life to help save the lives of others. Now there is such an award., This is the heart. The heart of gold for the ordinary people who protect us all., , This year, we establish such an award. For those who really deserve it. Those whose hearts are of gold, and that is why they are volunteers., Today I named 50 volunteer groups whose representatives will receive an award this year., And every year we will celebrate volunteer projects, other organizations, and new personalities. People should know who provides this aid for Ukraine. People should know whose heart gives us such a result, for which Ukrainians are grateful., Glory to everyone who helps our defense!, Glory to everyone who helps our volunteers!, Gratitude to everyone who is involved in the work of the volunteers!, And congratulations on Volunteer Day!, Glory to Ukraine!"
4 December 2022  - 21:53 ,"To get through the winter, we have to be even more resilient and even more united - address by the President of Ukraine",", Indomitable people of an indomitable country!, The fourth day of this winter is coming to an end. The winter, which will obviously be difficult. But still, it is worth perceiving this winter not as a test, but as time - time that brings us closer to the main thing - to victory. Each of these 90 winter days., The enemy really hopes to use winter against us: to make winter cold and hardship part of his terror. We have to do everything to endure this winter, no matter how hard it is. And we will endure. To endure this winter is to defend everything., Russia still has missiles and an advantage in artillery. Yes, but we have something that the occupier does not have and will not have. We defend our home, and that gives us the strongest motivation possible. We fight for freedom, and that always multiplies any force. We defend the truth, and this unites the whole world around Ukraine., We see happy people when they meet the Ukrainian flag in liberated cities - wherever Ukraine returns. The people, the Armed Forces, all of us return. And this means they are waiting for us wherever there is still an occupation. They are waiting and they believe that Ukraine will return. They are waiting and they know very well: if Russia invades, it will not be forever., To get through this winter, we have to help each other more than ever and care for each other even more. And please don't ask if you can help, and how. Just help when you see you can., To get through the winter, we have to be even more resilient and even more united than ever. There can be no internal conflicts and strife, which can weaken us all, even if someone out there thinks that somehow it will strengthen him personally. We need more interaction than ever. All of Ukraine has to become one big Point of Invincibility and work every day, work every night. The state, business, people - all of us, Ukrainians, all together., This autumn, a lot was done to strengthen the position of the state and to make the occupier lose. We must do everything so that the same can be said after this winter. Ukrainians worked round the clock to restore normal life after the Russian strikes. And no matter how large-scale the terror of the occupiers was, our desire to restore everything in our home was always even greater. It should continue to be so., Our defense forces firmly hold positions and even the most difficult directions. How many times have the occupiers planned to capture all of Donbas, to be in Bakhmut... How many times have they already announced new deadlines for their advance, their victories... Our guys are true heroes., And this is our key task - both for the state and the people - to do everything to support our defense forces, to strengthen our defense forces, to find everything necessary for our defense forces in the world., I know how difficult it is in Bakhmut, in Donbas. Guys, hold on! I am with you. The people are with you., In order to carry out this task - to carry it out successfully - we must always support each other, precisely for this. And I thank everyone who helps strengthen Ukraine and who after this winter will definitely be able to say that the approach of our victory is also his or her personal result, a personal achievement., Glory to all who fight for Ukraine and who work for Ukrainians!, Glory to our strong people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
3 December 2022  - 20:07 ,"Our victory being achieved by strength of arms and spirit, by strength of our unity – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, I held another meeting of the Staff. The commanders reported on the situation in specific directions – in the most important directions., In Donetsk region – Bakhmut, Soledar – now, as before, it's the hottest, most painful. We do everything to help our boys in this direction. Our heroes who are holding the defense there. Everyone there deserves the highest gratitude!, And now I would like to separately thank the border guards of the Chop detachment, who are fighting near Bakhmut and today ""landed"" another plane of the occupiers., Luhansk region and Kharkiv region – we're strengthening our forces. South – we continue to erase the capabilities of the occupiers. Border – we're strengthening the entire perimeter. Black Sea water area – we're working so that finally Kalibr missiles could be at least at the bottom of the sea., Of course, we discussed further steps in the area of total spiritual independence of Ukraine and protection of our state from informal networks of influence of the terrorist state., A separate conversation at the meeting of the Staff is about energy. Recovery progress and object protection. We are constantly working on it., The discussion on price caps, i.e. on limiting the export price of Russian oil, has ended in the world. Unfortunately, without big decisions, as you wouldn't call it a big decision to set such a limit for Russian prices, which is quite comfortable for the budget of a terrorist state., Russia has already caused huge losses to all countries of the world by deliberately destabilizing the energy market. And the world cannot dare its real energy disarmament. It's a weak position., And it's only a matter of time when stronger tools will have to be used anyway. It is a pity that this time will be lost., The logic is obvious: if the price limit for Russian oil is $60 instead of, for example, $30, which Poland and the Baltic countries talked about, then the Russian budget will receive about a hundred billion dollars a year., This money will go not only to the war and not only to Russia's further sponsoring of other terrorist regimes and organizations., This money will also be used to further destabilize precisely those countries that are now trying to avoid big decisions., Today, I held a meeting with the leaders of our foreign policy bloc., We summed up the week and are preparing new events for December and January. Very powerful steps. Ukraine's position will be heard, Ukraine's interests will be realized despite everything., And one more. Yesterday I spoke with students of universities: Skovoroda University in Pereiaslav, Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, Skovoroda Kharkiv National Pedagogical University. Three institutions out of many that keep the memory of Skovoroda and preserve Ukrainianness itself., And today I also visited the exhibition ""The World of Skovoroda"" at the Ukrainian House in Kyiv., And it is right that in such conditions, in such a year, events for the 300th anniversary of Skovoroda are taking place all over the country. It is right that there is strength, there is the strength to take care of Ukrainian in all its manifestations., Because our victory is being achieved by the strength of arms and the strength of the spirit. The strength of the soldiers and the strength of the people. The strength of the state and the strength of culture. The strength of our unity is our ability to work together for the sake of Ukrainian interests and our ability to support each other. Support, because we are Ukrainians, and the strength of this argument alone should be enough for all of us., Glory to all who fight for Ukraine!, Glory to all who work for our country!, Eternal memory and respect to all those who gave their lives for independence!, Glory to Ukraine!"
2 December 2022  - 23:45 ,"Thank you to everyone who, despite constant Russian shelling, is doing everything so that Ukrainians can live normally – address of President of Ukraine",", Good night, dear Ukrainians!, It was a special day of a special week., The nicest, the most symbolic thing is that today I had a privilege to honor with awards our heroes released from Russian captivity and members of our team – those who are working for the return of Ukrainians home., Now I want to thank once again everyone who is doing this task. A total of 1,331 – so many have been already released during the full-scale war., And we will not leave a single Ukrainian in Russian prisons, camps and ""isolation."" We remember everyone. The day will come – we will welcome them again free., All this week, we worked at various levels in European capitals in order to gain a critical mass of support for the launch of a special tribunal – a tribunal on Russian aggression., London, Paris, Berlin, Warsaw and other capitals... We are strengthening our position everywhere, accumulating the support of our partners. I am sure that there will be a tribunal, there will be justice., We are moving quite actively with regard to another point of the Ukrainian peace formula – food security. We use every day so that the world sees and feels that global stability is possible only together with Ukraine., Today, the third vessel within the framework of our initiative Grain from Ukraine entered the port of Odesa. 25,000 tonnes of humanitarian wheat will be sent to Somalia. The second vessel, which is finishing loading in the port of Chornomorsk, will be heading to Ethiopia with 30,000 tonnes of wheat on board. Also, the first vessel under this program – Grain from Ukraine – is heading to Ethiopia., And in general, by the end of spring, we will send about 60 vessels with such humanitarian cargo. It literally saves millions of people from starvation. And I am grateful to all our partners who joined the Ukrainian initiative., Another initiative of ours – grain export – made it possible to bring almost 13 million tonnes of Ukrainian foodstuffs to the food market. A significant contribution to world security. We are doing everything to increase the supply., Today, I want to mention all those who are returning normal life to the liberated areas, in particular to Kherson region and the city of Kherson. These are people from different regions – everyone has united, responded to the call for relief... These are our energy workers, builders, communications workers, repair crews, businesses, local leaders, mine clearance specialists., More than 200 explosive devices were found in just a few days this week. Demining continues., In Kherson region, every week there is more mobile communication coverage, more electricity and gas supply, more transport opportunities. Every week more access to normal medicine, educational and social services. Today, the broadcast of the Ukrainian telethon Edyni Novyny also started in Kherson., I thank everyone who, despite constant Russian shelling and various attempts by terrorists to make difficulties for us, is doing everything so that Ukrainians can live – live normally., And one more., These days we celebrate the 300th anniversary of the birth of Hryhorii Skovoroda – our philosopher, who taught happiness and self-knowledge, finding one's true self in this world., Today, I visited Pereiaslav, Kyiv region. Places where Skovoroda lived and taught., It would be funny if it weren't bitter that the occupiers are trying to steal this Ukrainian from Ukraine. They say something there, as if Skovoroda is theirs. But we know that they will not catch him. How it's impossible to catch, stop, break and capture Ukraine., These days we have taken some steps to guarantee the spiritual independence of our people. I see that people support these steps. And I see very powerful support., And that's not all. There will be more steps. Ukraine will never stop halfway again., Glory to all who fight and work for our country!, I thank everyone who defends and helps our people!, Glory to Ukraine! "
1 December 2022  - 22:47 ,We will guarantee spiritual independence to Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Free people of the indomitable country!, Every year on December 1, we recall an event that defined history. An event that said a lot about all of us, about Ukrainians. About who we are. And about who we will never become., On December 1, 31 years ago, a referendum was held that united the entire territory of our state. None of our people remained outside the All-Ukrainian decision. Kyiv and Sevastopol, Odesa and Crimea, Lviv and Cherkasy, Chernihiv and Kharkiv, Donetsk and Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk, Khmelnytskyi and Kirovohrad regions, Volyn and Dnipropetrovsk regions, Sumy and Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil, Zhytomyr region and Chernivtsi, Vinnytsia, Kyiv region, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Rivne... Everyone expressed their support., People confirmed the Act of Proclamation of Independence of Ukraine - freely and legally. It was a real referendum, not some kind of imitation. It was an honest referendum, and that is why it was recognized by the world., And it was important that not just politicians, but people in particular put an end to the history of the empire, which was built on denying the will of the people. Which killed, trying to perpetuate the denial of the will of the people, but which was overthrown by people anyway. And precisely by their own will., Since that day in 1991, Ukrainians have experienced many attempts to turn a dot into three dots or a semicolon. We saw many figures who could not put up with the fact that the empire had been overthrown., We are still defending Ukraine against such ""comrades"" who wanted to celebrate the centenary of the empire this year instead of another anniversary of freedom. They wanted..., But Ukrainian rules will prevail., Our desire to live freely expressed on August 24 and confirmed on December 1 will not be broken. Ukrainians will never again be gears of some empires. We have already gained it and we will ensure the full independence of our state., We will ensure, in particular, spiritual independence. We will never allow anyone to build an empire inside the Ukrainian soul., A meeting of the National Security and Defense Council was held today. The meeting at which we considered numerous facts of connections of certain religious circles in Ukraine with the aggressor state., Unfortunately, even Russian terror and full-scale war did not convince some figures that it is worth overcoming the temptation of evil. Well, we have to create conditions where no actors dependent on the aggressor state will have an opportunity to manipulate Ukrainians and weaken Ukraine from within., So, first. The National Security and Defense Council instructed the Government to submit to the Verkhovna Rada a draft law on making it impossible for religious organizations affiliated with centers of influence in the Russian Federation to operate in Ukraine., Second. The State Service for Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Conscience was commissioned to ensure the religious examination of the Management Statute of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church for the presence of a church-canonical connection with the Moscow Patriarchate and, if necessary, to take measures provided for by law., Third. Ensure the verification of the presence of legal grounds and compliance with the conditions of use by religious organizations of the property located on the territory of the National Kyiv-Pechersk Historical and Cultural Reserve., Fourth. All bodies responsible for ensuring national security must intensify measures to identify and counter the subversive activities of Russian special services in the religious environment of Ukraine. And apply personal sanctions - the surnames will be made public soon., And fifth. We need to raise the status and strengthen the capabilities of the State Service for Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Conscience. This structure will be reformed, which will enable it to really protect the rights and legitimate interests of the Ukrainians and the state., With these and other decisions, we guarantee Ukraine's spiritual independence., I would like to emphasize: in 1991, our state embarked on the legal and democratic path. We will continue this path. Only legal steps. Balanced decisions. And national interests., Today, we continued to work on the implementation of the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which I presented at the G19 summit, in particular its clause on food security. To this end, I spoke with the President of Senegal and the Chairperson of the African Union., About our Grain From Ukraine initiative. This is an initiative that really brings stability and predictability back to the world. And also about the way we can involve African countries in restoring the strength of international law and guaranteeing the completeness of global security., And one more thing. Today, another 50 Ukrainians were brought home from Russian captivity. Four officers, 46 sergeants and privates. Army, territorial defense, national guards, Navy and border guards. I thank our entire team, which works for the liberation of Ukrainians. Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Malyuk, Lubinets. Well done. I am grateful to everyone who helps!, In total, since February 24, more than 1,300 Ukrainians have already been returned from Russian captivity. We will bring back all the rest! All of Ukraine will be free. All Ukrainians will be at home., Glory to all who fight for our country!, Glory to all who work to protect Ukraine!, Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for independence!, Glory to Ukraine!"
30 November 2022  - 22:25 ,We are analyzing the intentions of the occupiers and preparing a countermeasure - even more powerful than now - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, I held another meeting of the Staff today., The main issues are the Donetsk region, Luhansk region, Kharkiv region, Zaporizhzhia region, Kherson region, Crimea, frontline territories and our state border. We are analyzing the intentions of the occupiers and are preparing a countermeasure - an even more powerful countermeasure than now., We considered the issue of providing for the military and supplying new equipment and ammunition., I separately held a meeting on energy and communication issues. We record the results of what has already been done to protect our systems. We are preparing new solutions., We are also preparing new solutions to prevent any opportunity for Russia to manipulate the internal life of Ukraine. We will provide details in due time., As of this evening, about 6 million subscribers in most regions of our country and in Kyiv are disconnected from electricity., The situation remains very difficult in the capital, as well as in the Kyiv, Vinnytsia, Lviv, Odesa, Khmelnytskyi and Cherkasy regions., Energy workers and utility workers, all our services are doing everything to stabilize the system and give people more energy for longer. And I want to emphasize once again: it is very important that people understand when and for what period of time they will be left without electricity., This is the responsibility of both the energy companies themselves and local authorities. People have a right to know. And to the extent that it is possible now, the predictability of life should be ensured. People see that in neighboring houses or on nearby streets, for some reason, the rules regarding light are different. And there should be justice and clarity., Today we have two very important pieces of international news., Canada has successfully completed the issuance of special bonds - bonds of sovereign support of Ukraine. The volume is 500 million Canadian dollars., In fact, Canada assumes this debt to help our nation. The funds will go to the state budget of Ukraine., I am grateful to our Canadian friends and personally to Mr. Justin Trudeau and Mrs. Chrystia Freeland for this manifestation of Canadian leadership., Leadership that demonstrates to other partners what can be effective right now to support Ukraine., And news from Germany., The Bundestag voted for a resolution recognizing the Holodomor as genocide of the Ukrainian people. This is a decision for justice, for truth. And this is a very important signal to many other countries of the world that Russian revanchism will not succeed in rewriting history., We would praise one more decision of Germany, which will certainly become historic, - to transfer the Patriot system to Ukraine. All generations of Ukrainians will thank Chancellor Scholz, as well as the entire generation of modern German politicians., Glory to everyone who defends Ukraine!, Gratitude to everyone who helps our state!, Glory to Ukraine!"
29 November 2022  - 23:33 ,"For Russia to be held to account for aggression, a Special Tribunal is needed, and we are doing everything to create it - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today, we took several new steps to restore justice to Ukraine, to bring to justice all those responsible for this criminal war., We are already cooperating with many countries and international organizations so that every Russian murderer receives the deserved punishment. We have already established cooperation with the International Criminal Court and will increase it., But, unfortunately, the available international legal instruments are not enough for justice., Even in the International Criminal Court, it is still impossible to bring the highest political and military leadership of Russia to justice for the crime of aggression against our state - for the primary crime. The crime that gave birth to all other crimes of this war - and not only after February 24, but also from 2014. That's when it all started., For there to be responsibility for aggression, a Special Tribunal is needed - in addition to the International Criminal Court. And we are doing everything to create such a tribunal., Today, the address of the First Lady of Ukraine to the Parliament and the people of Great Britain was dedicated to this task exactly., Olena's visit to the United Kingdom is currently underway. And on behalf of all Ukrainian men and women who suffered from Russian aggression, she called on Great Britain to become a leader in global efforts to establish a Special Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine and to restore justice., The British have this experience, it is part of our shared historical memory. In the winter of 1942, when no one could predict when World War II would end, it was in London that representatives of the Allies signed the Declaration of St. James's Palace. The document that started the path to the Nuremberg trials, that is, to justice after that war., Now we already have strong cooperation with the Netherlands, which is helping with the creation of a prosecutor's office to collect evidence of war crimes. We are working with France, which helps us in field work to document Russian evil., And we must unite the world majority in support of the draft resolution of the UN General Assembly regarding the Special Tribunal., We must develop the necessary legal architecture to make the tribunal work. We must fully implement this clause of our Peace Formula and really ensure justice after this war, just as after the Second World War. I believe that Great Britain will show its leadership precisely in this struggle for justice., Today, the Russian War Crimes exhibition was opened in London - this is a project that demonstrates to the world what Russia has brought to Ukrainian soil. This exhibition worked in Davos, during the World Economic Forum, also in New York - during the UN General Assembly, in Brussels, at the headquarters of NATO. Now the British will see it. All leading countries will know and see what evil Russism is responsible for., A meeting of justice ministers of the G7 countries was held in Berlin - an extremely useful one. Ukraine was represented there by the Prosecutor General and the Minister of Justice of our country. This meeting was devoted precisely to bringing the occupiers and the aggressor state to justice for everything they have done. Following the meeting, we can see an obvious willingness to work together to eventually restore the force of international law, restore the full effect of the UN Charter and bring Russia to a fair liability., I spoke with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz today - it is Germany that chairs the G7 this year. We discussed our cooperation both at the bilateral level and in international institutions. The priorities are clear - protection against missile terror, energy restoration, food security. I thanked the Chancellor for his support., The situation at the front is difficult. Despite extremely big Russian losses, the occupiers are still trying to advance in the Donetsk region, gain a foothold in the Luhansk region, move in the Kharkiv region, they are planning something in the south., But we are holding out and - most importantly - do not allow the enemy to fulfill their intentions. They said they would capture the Donetsk region in spring, summer, autumn... Winter begins this week already. They wasted their regular army there, they lose hundreds of mobilized and mercenaries there every day, they use barrier troops there…, This year, Russia will lose a hundred thousand of its soldiers killed and only God knows how many mercenaries. And Ukraine will stand. And the world will do everything to ensure that everyone guilty of this criminal war is brought to justice., And I also want to thank the Netherlands for today's decision - the House of Representatives of the States General recognized Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. Step by step, the world will put everything in its place., Glory to all who fight for freedom! , Glory to all who work for our victory! , Eternal memory to all who gave their lives for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
29 November 2022  - 15:13 ,Ukraine will become a role model of reconstruction - President addressed the General Assembly of the International Bureau of Expositions regarding the holding of Expo 2030 in Odesa,", Mr. President! , Mr. Secretary General! , Ladies and Gentlemen!, I am honoured to present Ukraine’s candidate for hosting World’s Fair 2030. To present Odesa – and the entire Black Sea region., Why Odesa? Why Ukraine? Why the Black Sea?, This year, Ukraine has become the world’s role model of bravery. Billions of people from every continent could see what Ukrainian invincibility means, why Russian terror will not achieve its goal., And they will see how Ukraine becomes a role model of reconstruction. Neither winter cold, nor darkness nor other manifestations of terror will help Russia conquer Ukrainians., The time of Ukrainian victory shall come. And then…, The reconstruction of our country will become the most momentous economic, technological, and humanitarian project of our time., Even now, we engage dozens of our partner countries to rebuild Ukraine., The total volume of work amounts to over a trillion dollars., Even now, we create a special patronage system., The system will enable leading countries and companies to take patronage over the reconstruction of Ukrainian regions, cities, industries, and enterprises. Not just to recover them but to show that a free world and conscious countries are always more powerful than any tyranny and aggression., We can already see the interest in patronage from France and Great Britain, the Netherlands and Germany, Denmark and Finland, Italy and Türkiye, Poland and Portugal, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, Latvia and Estonia, Switzerland and Slovakia, Austria and Greece, Canada and the United States of America, Japan and Australia. And this is not a full list of the countries., In 2030, Ukrainian reconstruction will have already shown a significant part of the projected results, and Ukraine will be the country to demonstrate what humanity is capable of when all peoples cooperate for peace and security, for development, and a more comfortable future for all., And this is, by the way, a fundamental meaning behind the World’s Fairs., So, the reality of our country and the spirit of the World’s Fairs will ally. Specifically in Ukraine, specifically in 2030., Even now, we have already proved that the Black Sea region is one of the key guarantors of the world’s stability., Our Odesa is that big port that ensures the social well-being of dozens of countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe., This year, we have proved it with our Grain Export Initiative., We will solidify it with another international humanitarian project “Grain From Ukraine”. It will help recover food security in the poorest countries that are balancing at the edge of famine and destabilization – Ethiopia, Somalia, Yemen, and others. These and many other countries will be widely aware of why Odesa and the Black Sea are so significant. We will save millions of people – Odesa will save millions of people thanks to the work of its ports., We are already integrating Ukraine into the European Union. We have already become a part of the EU Single Market. We will become a part of the EU institutions. We have already joined the EU Single Energy System. We will become those whose potential in “green” energy will replace dirty Russian fossil fuel for Europe. We have already helped Europe to overcome many internal controversies and actually unite – unite in its actions. Enhanced by Ukraine, Europe will become a truly independent and really solid global player., 2030 is the time when we will be able to celebrate it. To celebrate it together with all Europeans., Is it fair that the World’s Fairs have never been hosted in this part of Europe? Many world regions have already been represented. Europe had the honour to host the World’s Fairs in different years. But not the East of Europe., We should change it. And Odesa will be a perfect place to do it., The city that through the centuries has been tied economically and culturally with Türkiye and Romania, Georgia and Bulgaria, Moldova and other countries of our region as well as many world’s regions., The city that has always been multinational and multicultural – the city of diversity. , The city that may host the World’s Fair for the first time but has been connected with the world for centuries., Ladies and Gentlemen!, When you visit Ukraine and our Odesa in 2030, you will sense the power, freedom, and culture of not just one country and one city. You will experience the potential of the entire humanity., That is why it is 2030. That is why it is Odesa, Ukraine, and the Black Sea. That is why it is the World’s Fair., May the victory of freedom and our striving for peace become widely seen!, Thank you for your attention!, Glory to Ukraine!"
28 November 2022  - 22:27 ,Ukraine will never be a place of devastation - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, A brief report on today. The morning began with the Staff meeting. Frontline. Provision of the army. Energy sector. Communication. Points of Invincibility. Strengthening our air defense. Working with partners. The situation in the frontline areas and suppression of Russian firing positions. We keep all key issues in the focus of the Staff’s attention., That day, as every other day, the occupiers again shelled Kherson and the communities of the region. In just one week, the enemy fired 258 times on 30 settlements of our Kherson region., The Russian army also damaged the pumping station that supplied water to Mykolaiv., Well, what can be said about them? This is the real essence of those random ""comrades"" who took over Russia. After 20 years of rule, a large part of their own state is in such devastation, as if a war had taken place there. And this is not a war - it’s just because they have come., They are capable of nothing but devastation. This is all they leave behind. And what they are doing now against Ukraine is their attempt to take revenge. To take revenge for the fact that Ukrainians have repeatedly defended themselves from them., Ukraine will never be a place for devastation. Ukraine will never accept orders from these ""comrades"" from Moscow. We will do everything to restore every object, every house, every enterprise destroyed by the occupiers., Today I spoke about Ukraine's needs for protection and reconstruction with the foreign ministers of seven Northern European countries. Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, Norway, Iceland. I thanked them for this joint visit to Ukraine - a gesture of support and solidarity that is very important right now., We have agreements on further cooperation in the defense and energy spheres, in the reconstruction projects of our state and in the sanctions sphere., The Ukrainian Peace Formula was discussed with each of the delegations, in great detail - the possible participation of each state in the implementation of the points of the Formula., We are actively working to create a Special Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. We are working at different levels., In particular, I discussed this today with the foreign ministers of the partner countries. Head of the Office Andriy Yermak took part in the conference held in France. Members of the working group on the issue of creating a Tribunal work there. Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin and the First Lady of Ukraine represented our country in Britain today - a conference on combating sexual violence in wartime was held there. Mr. Kostin is preparing to meet with the G7 ministers of justice in Berlin tomorrow., The main topic of all these events is Russia's responsibility for war and terror. There will be more news tomorrow., I spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. By the way, the Netherlands provides substantial assistance to Ukraine in the preparation of the Tribunal for aggression and in establishing the truth about all Russian murderers and torturers. Ukraine is grateful for this., I heard a very important signal from Mr. Prime Minister Rutte - a signal about next year. Support for our state will only increase., I met with the ambassadors of our United24 fundraising platform. Andriy Shevchenko, Oleksandr Usyk, Scott Kelly - they were in Kyiv, and Elina Svitolina, Liev Schreiber and Timothy Snyder joined the meeting via video call. The main issue is getting through this winter, helping Ukraine with generators and other energy equipment. Detailed news will be tomorrow, but I will note: we will do everything so that Ukraine receives the maximum possible help from the world., And one more thing., The volume of accumulated funds for our Grain from Ukraine initiative is growing and already exceeds 180 million U.S. dollars. This is already one of the historically largest Ukrainian humanitarian initiatives. And it will be even bigger., Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Great Britain, Greece, Estonia, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Canada, Qatar, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, USA, Türkiye, Hungary, Finland, France, Croatia, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Sweden, European Union have already announced their financial, technical or logistical contribution to the Grain From Ukraine initiative - this is a significant participation. Plus the Republic of Korea. Japan - from the first days. And also NATO and, of course, the UN., I am thankful to everyone who participates!, Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine implement our Peace Formula! I am sure that it can be fully implemented - all points just as the point on food security., Glory to each of our warriors! Glory to all who work for the victory of our state!, And please pay attention to the air sirens, don't forget that., Glory to Ukraine!"
27 November 2022  - 22:08 ,"Helping one another, we will get through this winter and Russia's attempt to use the cold against people - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Another week of full-scale war is coming to an end - a week in which we accomplished a lot. All together. Thanks to our unity., After the massive terrorist attack last Wednesday, we have been restoring electricity generation and supply day after day., As of today, in most regions of the country, only stabilization schedules of shutdowns are in effect. The situation is under control by the energy workers., And for that, I am thankful to the thousands of people who worked round the clock all over our state to restore light, water, heat and communication. I thank all the employees of energy companies, utility services, repair crews, regional authorities and leaders of local communities who helped. I would also like to thank the businesses that participated., Ukrainian unity again and again demonstrates its strength, demonstrates our effectiveness., I thank all Ukrainian entrepreneurs who are now making their offices, branches, cafes and other facilities new Points of Invincibility. Who do everything to help people., We understand that terrorists are preparing new strikes. We know that for sure. And as long as they have missiles, they won’t stop, unfortunately., But our ability to help each other and take care of the most vulnerable - the elderly, families with children, those who lost homes and relatives in the war - our mutual assistance is one of the elements of protection against terror and our strength., The upcoming week can be as hard as the one that passes. Our Defense Forces are preparing. The whole state is preparing. We work out all scenarios, including with our partners., And our unity must be ready. So please do not leave without help those whom you can help. And please pay attention to the air alerts during the week., Together and helping each other we will pass this challenge of war as well: this winter, this Russia's attempt to use the cold against people., The situation at the front remains very difficult. And most of all - in the Donetsk region, as in previous weeks., I want to thank all our warriors, all our heroes for their resilience today!, To endure now and defend ourselves now is to endure and defend ourselves for generations to come for all Ukrainians throughout our beautiful land., We are doing and will do everything possible to strengthen our defense. We are doing and will do everything to hold Russia accountable for this war, for this terror., And in order to achieve these results, there will be new important steps in the upcoming week., I thank all our partners who help us! I am grateful to every leader who perceives the defense of Ukraine as the defense of freedom and security for his country as well!, Together we will endure everything. I'm sure of that!, Glory to Ukraine!"
26 November 2022  - 20:04 ,Never again should hunger be used as a weapon – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Indestructible people of the indestructible country!, Today, we held the first International Summit on Food Security. We held it in Kyiv – together with our partners. And precisely these days were chosen deliberately, when we commemorate the victims of the Holodomor of 1932-1933., Ukrainians went through genocide. And today we are doing everything possible and impossible to stop Russia's new genocidal policy. A new one – but similar to the one that killed millions of people in the 20th century. And we don't just fight off aggression. Step by step, we are creating a system that will stop aggression, dismantle its consequences, and guarantee long-term security – the security of Ukraine, all of Europe, and the world., Food security is one of the key elements of global stability. This is where Ukraine's leading role is most evident. Thanks to our export grain initiative from three Black Sea ports, we sent about 12 million tonnes of food to the world market. 40 countries of the world. Of this amount, more than two and a half million tonnes are for countries that are not just short of food, but in a severe crisis., As part of the UN Food Programme, we have helped countries where people are literally starving or on the verge of starvation. These include Ethiopia and Yemen. We also helped Somalia and Afghanistan. And this is just the beginning., Today, we officially announced the launch of our new humanitarian initiative. Grain From Ukraine. And we already have agreements with many partners on joint work within Grain from Ukraine., The European Union, the United States, France, the UK, Germany, Japan, Qatar, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Italy, Austria, Spain, Sweden, Slovenia, Switzerland and others. More than 20 countries supported our food security summit. The total amount that we have accumulated for Grain From Ukraine is already about $150 million. Work continues. We are preparing up to 60 ships., All of us together do not just send Ukrainian foodstuffs to those countries that suffer the most from the food crisis. We affirm that never again should hunger be used as a weapon. If it weren't for Ukrainian food, if it weren't for our joint leadership with our partners, social stability in such regions as North Africa or the Middle East would not have been maintained. This is exactly what Russia wanted. We must – and we can! – not allow this., Today, I met with the Prime Minister of Belgium. We discussed our joint actions – and not only for the sake of food security. We signed a declaration on Belgium's support for Ukraine's full membership in both the European Union and NATO – this is an important signal. We discussed further political and defense cooperation, sanctions against Russia, the possibility of Belgium helping us through this winter., Today, a meeting of the Lublin Triangle took place in Kyiv – at the level of prime ministers – Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. They signed a joint statement on further support for Ukraine and the international legal order. So, today is a very busy diplomatic day. A day that strengthened both Ukraine and our partners., Today, our power engineers continued restoring the system – and we now have more opportunities to generate and supply electricity. But, unfortunately, not enough to make the supply completely stable., As of this morning, half as many subscribers have been disconnected from the grid than last night. However, in 14 regions and in Kyiv, there are still restrictions for more than a hundred thousand subscribers in each of the regions., If consumption increases in the evening, the number of outages may increase. This once again shows how important it is now to save power and consume it rationally., This afternoon, the enemy launched a missile attack on Dnipropetrovsk region – on private houses, on ordinary houses. There are wounded. They shelled Donetsk region, the south, and other regions., Russia is turning this day – the day of remembrance – into a day of terror. The occupiers will definitely be responsible for all this. And we will drive them out of our land., And one more., Today, we managed to release 12 more Ukrainians from Russian captivity. Of them, three are civilians, two are officers, and seven are privates and sergeants. This week alone, we returned 98 of our people from captivity to Ukraine. We will return all the others., Thanks to everyone who helps us!, Thank you to every leader who works with us for the sake of European and global security!, Glory to our soldiers and our indestructible people! Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine., And please, today honor the memory of Ukrainian men and women, children and adults, whose lives were taken by the Holodomor-genocide."
26 November 2022  - 15:12 ,Opening address of President of Ukraine at the inaugural International Summit оn Food Security under Grain from Ukraine humanitarian program,", Dear attendees!, It is a great honor to have you here with us today, Ladies and Gentlemen!, I welcome you to our capital, the city of Kyiv, to this special event for us, which is dedicated to a special initiative and takes place on such a special day for our state, for Ukraine., Every year, on the last Saturday in November, we honor the memory of millions of people. Millions of tortured and murdered Ukrainians. Women, men, elderly people. Millions of children. Millions of victims of famine. In 1921, 1922, 1923, 1946, 1947, and the darkest years – 1932-1933. Today is the 90th anniversary of the genocide committed against us by the totalitarian Stalinist regime. Different historians call different numbers of victims, but either way, all of them are shocking. From four to eight million perished Ukrainians., We remember how it is when they want to destroy your people., Almost every family has been affected in one way or another. Almost everyone among us has someone in the National Memory Book of victims. We remember the stories of those who managed to survive these horrors, truly vivid memories. How they take away everything. How you can be shot for a hidden bowl of grain or flour. How a large family shares a loaf of bread for a week. How it is a soup from two rotten potatoes to eat the whole day. How in the morning there is no strength to even live and open your eyes. How it is hard to fall asleep at night because you just want to eat. How exhausted people fall dead on the road. And others are too exhausted to take and bury their bodies. How whole families die, how streets wound up dead, how villages perish., How in already independent Ukraine, even in the new millennium, our grandparents, who survived the Holodomor, treated food with respect. How carefully they gathered the crumbs that remained on the table after dinner into a handful. How they said: there were times in childhood when we dreamed of a piece of bread or a plate of borscht., Such terrible memories. We know about it. We remember that. We have to! And we see what is happening today in the world, what is happening in Ukraine. They want to destroy us again with bombs, bullets, cold, and again with hunger., On February 24, Russia started a full-scale war against our society, the people of Ukraine, against our state. The occupation and the blockade left thousands of people without food and water from the very beginning., We will not allow millions of people in the world to be left without food and water. We remember how it used to be. Unfortunately, we know how it happens today. We won't make it happen tomorrow. Neither here, nor in any country of the world on the entire planet., Our flag is a blue sky and a golden wheat field. Our land has always given generous fruits. Our country has always shared these fruits with the whole world. Ukraine is traditionally one of the largest exporters of food to different countries of the world on different continents. Our wheat was highly valued in Africa and the Middle East. Dairy products, vegetables, fruits, corn – in Europe. Sunflower oil was on shelves all over the world., This year, unfortunately, is different. Russian troops surrounded Ukrainian ports. They blocked the export of our food. They put the world on the brink of starvation. They provoked a food crisis. The rapid increase in the price of products undermines the economic security of ordinary people, the well-being of millions of families, domestic stability and regional security. Mass protests due to rising food, fertilizer, and fuel prices threaten many countries and societies., We must prevent the further spread of this crisis and this global challenge., Ukraine, as one of the guarantors of global food security, will continue making its key contribution. Despite the war. Despite any challenges. Despite the obstacles. Despite the attempt to destroy us. Ukraine will fulfill its export obligations regarding the supply of grain and other foodstuffs to the global market. Ukraine is a fighter for life, its own and that of other peoples. Life without slavery and hunger., The first practical proof of this was the Black Sea Grain Initiative. The export of Ukrainian food was unblocked. To date, almost 500 vessels have left our ports. This is 12 million tonnes of foodstuffs for 40 countries of the world. And for all societies, because when we talk about continents and states, first of all, we are talking about people. In particular, those suffering from the food crisis, who found themselves on the brink of this challenge – on the brink of starvation., However, the Grain Initiative, unfortunately, still operates not at its full capacity. Russia is trying to delay the movement of vessels. There are more than 80 ships in line in the Bosphorus. We advocate an increase in the number of ports and the indefinite continuation of this important initiative. So that Russia does not block it again. Again and again., At the same time, it is obvious that today even the full functioning of the grain corridor is insufficient to meet food needs. Especially of those countries that are in acute danger of hunger. To overcome this and food threats in general, Ukraine has organized this event. This is the first such event – the International Summit on Food Security. Here I want to announce and tell you about our new international initiative, supported by you, colleagues, and we are very grateful to you – Grain from Ukraine. Within its framework, Ukrainian food will be sent to countries in Africa and Asia., Our goal is ambitious and specific – to save at least 5 million people from hunger. On this path, Ukraine has already taken the first steps – sent the first ships. In the middle of November – 27,000 tonnes of wheat for Ethiopia. Another vessel is being loaded today. And this is another 30,000 tonnes of wheat for people in Ethiopia. Three more vessels are currently going to the ports of Ukraine for loading. They will deliver more than 80,000 tonnes of food wheat to the countries that need it the most., In general, under the Grain From Ukraine program, by the end of next spring, we plan to send at least 60 vessels from our ports – at least ten per month – to countries at risk of famine and drought. This is Ethiopia, these are Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Congo, Kenya, Nigeria. All of them are in dire need of help. Imagine – just one ship with grain provides food for 90,000 people. Sixty such ships will be able to prevent the starvation of at least 5 million inhabitants of the world., We invite other states and socially responsible businesses to this humanitarian initiative, humanitarian program. And I am happy to announce today that on the day of its launch, 20 countries joined Grain From Ukraine and there will be more., And I am glad that today we all gathered together in Kyiv. Some are offline, some are online. But in this format, today the participants of the International Summit on Food Security are President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, President of France Emmanuel Macron, and Federal Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz. Prime Ministers of Poland, Lithuania, Romania, and Belgium: Mateusz Morawiecki, Ingrida Šimonytė, Nicolae Ciucă, Alexander De Croo. President of Hungary Katalin Novák. UN Secretary General Mr. Guterres. Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte. Prime Minister of Sweden Ulf Kristersson and Prime Minister of Croatia Andrej Plenković. Presidents of Finland, Latvia, Estonia, Slovenia, Bulgaria. Secretary General of NATO. High-ranking officials of the UK, the Czech Republic, Italy, Austria, Spain, Qatar, and Canada. The United States Agency for International Development, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the World Food Programme in Ukraine, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. I believe that the mix is strong enough for the first such initiative. I want to thank you all., Based on the results of the summit, we will issue a Joint Statement. It will remain open for accession by interested parties. However, we welcome not only joining it but also any other format of participation in this program. Because its goal is our common goal – to prevent hunger in the world. The future of humanity depends on the readiness to respond effectively to the challenges of today. And one of the most important tasks is to have effective mechanisms – and this is one such mechanism, which is effective and functional – to guarantee food security., Today, I want to suggest that a new international institution has been created as a continuation of this initiative. An institution that will be a new, efficient and effective tool to prevent global threats and rapidly respond to them. All threats: food, humanitarian, security. With headquarters in Kyiv or Odesa, from where a ship will soon depart within the Grain From Ukraine program., Ladies and Gentlemen!, Amid ongoing Russian aggression, it is no less important to recognize the Holodomor of 1932–1933 as an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people. This has already been done by the United States, Canada, Australia, Poland – in total, by our friends from 17 countries. In 2022 it was Brazil and the Czech Republic. The day before, I called on the states and international organizations that have not yet done so to do this. On November 23, Romania approved the relevant decision. We are grateful. On November 24 it was Ireland. On November 25 – Moldova. I invite others to join this important historical truth. This will be a strong manifestation of solidarity with Ukraine in these extremely difficult times for us., In addition, there is something that can be done today. All of Ukraine will hold a national minute of silence today. We will light a memorial candle in our windows. We invite all other countries and nations to join us., At 16:00 Kyiv time. At 15:00 CET. When it will be 2:00 p.m. in London, it will be 9:00 a.m. in New York and Toronto, 7:30 p.m. in New Delhi, 10:00 p.m. in Beijing, 11:00 p.m. in Tokyo and Seoul, and 1:00 a.m. in Sydney. As proof that we all do not forget, we all remember the past and are ready to build a different, just future together. The human future, at any time of the day or night., Finally, I invite everyone to Ukraine in a year – for our next second summit – the International Summit on Food Security and our Grain From Ukraine initiative. To evaluate joint efforts. To outline further plans. I am sure, we will be able to achieve results and overcome all threats only united, only together. We can win only together. Ukraine and the civilized world without war, without terrorism, without hunger., Thank you very much!, Glory to Ukraine!"
25 November 2022  - 22:05 ,The key task this week is energy – address of President,", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, The key task of today, as well as of other days this week, is energy. From Wednesday to today, it was possible to halve the number of people for whom electricity is cut off to stabilize the system., As of this evening, blackouts continue in most regions and in Kyiv. In total, more than six million subscribers. Almost 12 million subscribers were disconnected from the grid on Wednesday evening., Most of the problems are currently in the capital of Ukraine, as well as in Kyiv region, Odesa region, Lviv region, Vinnytsia region and Dnipropetrovsk region., Please, it is necessary to consume electricity sparingly in all regions, as before., If you don't have a power outage, it doesn't mean the problem is over. Please, if you have electricity, this does not mean that you can turn on several powerful electrical appliances at once., Spiked power draws are recorded every evening, which cause an increase in emergency blackouts. Now, as before, it is necessary to save energy., Points of Invincibility are deployed throughout the country. But I know that, unfortunately, not in all cities the local government has done a good job. In particular, there are many complaints in Kyiv. In fact, only the Points that are deployed at the base of the State Emergency Service and at the railway station of the capital are normally provided, and other Points still need to be improved, to put it mildly. Please pay attention. Kyiv residents need more protection., As of this evening, 600,000 subscribers have been disconnected from the grid in the city. Many Kyiv residents were without electricity for more than 20 or even 30 hours. I expect quality work from the mayor's office. No one will forgive anyone for desecrating the Kyiv Points of Invincibility. Please be more serious. As well as lies in reports of various levels., I was in Vyshgorod, Kyiv region today, where a Russian missile destroyed an apartment building and damaged the houses of an entire residential neighborhood., Six people have been killed then, dozens have been injured. My condolences to the families of the victims. We do everything to help and we help., I visited two Points of Invincibility in Vyshgorod: at the base of the State Emergency Service and at a local school. They are arranged exactly as it should be., In total, there are now more than 4,000 Points in the country, and it is the responsibility of each local leader to ensure that everything that should be there for people really works., I spoke today with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen., I thanked her for the decision to provide a EUR 2.5 billion macro-financial assistance. They approved another EUR 0.5 billion by the end of the year and discussed the preparation of the support package for the next year., They also agreed on new steps in energy support for Ukraine., Today, I took part in the international symposium ""The idea of Europe"" in Lithuania., I called on the partners to take new steps for the sake of our joint victory and thanked Poland and the Baltic States for their principled stance to cap the price of exported Russian energy., I believe that the partners' proposals to introduce a more significant price restriction for Russian oil than was sounded this week are quite valid., In the evening, I signed another decree awarding our soldiers. Some 216 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were given state awards., I would especially like to mention the fighters of the 71st separate hunting brigade and the 24th Aidar assault battalion for their bravery and effectiveness in destroying the enemy and conducting counter-offensive actions. As well as the border guards of the Lviv and Mohyliv-Podilsky detachments, who are ferocious in defense of the Bakhmut and Avdiyivka directions. Thank you, warriors!, Thank you to everyone who fights for our country! Who is doing everything to suppress the occupiers that are shelling, unfortunately, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and our other cities., Thank you to everyone who works for Ukraine and Ukrainians! To everyone who brings heat, water, electricity and communication back to people., Glory to our indestructible people!, Glory to all of you – well done!, Glory to Ukraine!,  ,  "
25 November 2022  - 12:25 ,"Europe's dependence on Russian energy resources began to decrease, and should completely vanish - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the European Idea international symposium",", Dear friends!, Dear colleagues!, Dear Gitanas, thank you for the invitation to take part in this discussion in Kaunas., This year we all saw a very important thing., It's like any athlete that can become champion only when participating in the competition., Like any judge that can convince everyone of his unbiased work and wisdom when the case hearing has started., Any teacher sees for himself what he is worth when students return to him years after and it is clearly seen in their eyes and life circumstances whether they have perceived what they have been taught., This year we saw Europe we've all been striving for. Europe we've been building for decades and dreaming of for much longer., We saw Europe in action. We saw Europe not only in its striving for justice, but also in the protection of justice. We saw Europe not only manifesting certain values, but also capable of winning on the basis of its values., We saw a united Europe not only as a goal or a set of agreements at the political level, but also as the results being achieved here and now., Europe has made conclusions from its historical mistakes made by previous generations. European nations no longer leave each other alone when tyranny starts an offensive. European leaders defend what unites all of us much more fiercely than what coincides with certain personal ideological views. European states achieve things that seemed fantasies ten years ago., This year the frontline in Ukraine has become the line of struggle of Europe for itself. 274 days have passed and it is obvious that the anti-European aggression of Russia will fail, and European freedom will be guaranteed., Russia still resorts to various forms of terror so far. Russia still has enough missiles and artillery to kill people everyday and provoke new difficulties for Ukraine and the whole of Europe., But what Russian imperialism has always bet on and what has ultimately caused Europe's defeat isn't and won't be the case. There is no split between Europeans. And maintaining such reality in Europe is our common task #1., This year Europe finally carries out energy disarmament of Russia. The continent's dependence on Russian energy resources has started to reduce. And it must vanish completely. And one of the key instruments for that is to limit Russian profit from exports of its resources., The introduction of price caps, i.e. forcible price restriction for Russian oil, has already become the topic of discussion in Europe and the world. And there are allegedly discussions about the level of 60 or 70 U.S. dollars., No doubt, such words are just sandbagging. They're rather an attempt to imitate something than to do something., And I am grateful to our Polish and Baltic colleagues for their quite relevant proposals. Limiting the price at the level of up to 30 U.S. dollars per barrel seems a more feasible proposal. And I am grateful that such a proposal has been put forward and is being advocated. Now is the time to ensure this achievement of Europe as well., And on the basis of this and other similar achievements, none of the potential enemies of Europe will ever be able to blackmail our continent with energy weapons., The energy security of Europe, and therefore the price security, will now be based first of all on cooperation and solidarity between Europeans, and on European energy rules., We also have one more result, which is definitely important., Dear friends!, This year we have eliminated the gray zone on the EU borders, which Ukraine has been staying in for decades., Our state has become a candidate for EU membership and implements this perspective. Hence, we are finally eliminating the strategic uncertainty, which has been the source of instability for the whole continent and instigated Russia's revanchism., And we must begin our accession negotiations just as quickly as we've gained the candidate status., When Ukraine's fate is determined, the fate of the whole center and east of Europe is determined. Ukraine is and will be free, Ukraine is and will be democratic, Ukraine is and will be strong. Ukraine exists and will exist. Hence, Europe exists and will exist., So when we guarantee a long-standing security for Ukraine, we guarantee the same security for the whole continent., That is why, on the basis of what we have already managed to achieve, we must do one more thing., A very practical one., I have no doubt that eventually we will implement the Ukraine Peace Formula, stop the Russian aggression, and dismantle the threats it has brought to Ukraine, Europe and the world., But we must already show our vitality, the energetic nature of Europe., Just as the front line in Ukraine became the line of Europe's struggle for itself, the reconstruction of Ukraine must become for Europe a reconstruction of itself., This is the largest economic and humanitarian project of our generations. The greatest opportunities for the economic development of European countries. The biggest opportunities for European companies and the biggest boost for European production., Hence, this is the biggest potential for our social development., The implementation of this project has already begun., When we rebuild energy sphere to withstand Russian terror, it is rebuilding Europe. When we rebuild our infrastructure, social facilities, and housing to provide for Ukrainians, we give the whole of Europe an incentive to work for itself together with us. When we look for and find new logistics, production and trade opportunities for Ukraine, we look for and find them for everyone who cooperates with us., We do it as equals. We do this for our common interests. And that's how we must overcome the key challenge facing us now in order to strengthen us all., We must endure this winter - winter everyone will remember., We must do everything to remember not what it has threatened us with, but what we've managed to do to protect ourselves from this threat., And that is why we need to clearly understand the idea of Europe. A united Europe - it is very important., I often hear the same question - how Europe can help Ukraine ., Of course, we are grateful for that, but is the question formed correctly?, Europe can help itself. It's not about helping Ukraine stand up to Russia, it's about Europe being able to help itself stand up to Russia., It is not only in Ukraine that millions of people are without light and heat because of Russian terror. It is on the eastern flank of Europe that millions of Europeans are without light and heat due to Russian terror., It is not only Ukraine that Russia wants to break, it is Europe that Russia wants to break., We are all parts of one whole. What was a dream. What started with politics. What has become our life - a united Europe., This is the key idea., There is no Ukraine separate from Europe, just as there is no Poland or Lithuania or Romania or Latvia or Germany or France separate from Europe. This is our continent. This is our life. , And this is our path that we can endure. Just as this winter and this war. All Europeans together., I thank you for your attention!, Thank you for your continued support!, Glory to Ukraine!"
24 November 2022  - 22:25 ,Russia has not found a way to break us and will not find it - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Restoration continues all day today - we are gradually restoring electricity, heat, water supply and communication., As of this evening, there are still problems with water in 15 regions., The most difficult situation is in the Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, Lviv, Poltava and Kharkiv regions. But together with the supply of electricity to critical infrastructure, we also provide water and heat supply., The situation with electricity remains difficult in almost all regions. But still, we are moving away from the blackout little by little - every hour we restore power to new and new consumers., It is still the most difficult in the capital and 15 regions: Vinnytsia, Dnipropetrovsk, Zhytomyr, Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Lviv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava, Ternopil, Kharkiv, Kherson, Khmelnytskyi. There are also problems in other regions., Energy workers, utility workers, business - everyone is doing their part to give light again. This is truly a nationwide task - Ukraine is working as unitedly as possible in this., Thanks to the State Emergency Service and our entire system of regional administrations for the rapid deployment of the network of Points of Invincibility. In total, as of now, 4,362 points have been launched in most regions., And this is not yet the final figure - the network will grow according to how the points will be provided with generators and communication., Please, if your city has been without electricity or heat for more than 12 hours, use our Points of Invincibility., Assistance will also be provided at all police stations, at the facilities of the State Emergency Service., Please, if you know single or elderly people who need help, be sure to help them in these circumstances., A very important initiative was launched by our partners in the European Union. The European Parliament together with a network of European cities launched the ""Generators of Hope"" program. This will allow us to use the opportunities of horizontal cooperation in Europe - with cities, with businesses - and provide Ukraine with the energy equipment it needs now., I thank Mrs. Roberta Metsola, President of the European Parliament, and all our friends in the European Union who have already joined and are still joining., I held another meeting of the Staff today., Energy and communication issues were analyzed in great detail: the protection of the energy system from new Russian strikes, restoration work and the supply of equipment and the involvement of specialists., Special attention is paid to the communication system. No matter what the terrorists are planning, we have to preserve communication., Russia wants Ukrainians to not just find themselves without light and heat... Terrorists want to isolate us from each other so that we do not feel each other. Therefore, this is a fundamental question., And there will be additional decisions regarding this issue. We are preparing them., Of course, the situation on the frontline was examined very carefully and in detail at the meeting of the Staff. No matter how difficult it may be, we are holding the key frontiers in all directions. Our guys defend bravely. And there are directions where we are preparing to advance., We observe how the occupiers are trying to redeploy additional forces. We do everything to ""subtract"" these forces of theirs., Almost every hour, I receive reports of strikes by the occupiers at Kherson and other communities of the region. Such terror began immediately after the Russian army was forced to flee from the Kherson region. This is the revenge of those who lost., They do not know how to fight. The only thing they can still do is terrorize. Either energy terror, or artillery terror, or missile terror - that's all that Russia has degraded to under its current leaders., It is only the liberation of our land and reliable security guarantees for Ukraine that can protect our people from any Russian escalations., We work with partners every day for this. There will be important news soon., I addressed the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly today - the assembly is currently working in Poland., I called for the reform of this Organization so that it could finally help restore security in Europe., The principle of decision-making in the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly is that it is necessary to agree on decisions for many months and to convince absolutely everyone, even to deprive the delegation of a terrorist state of its rights. It definitely shouldn't be so. During such a war, during such terror, decisions against the guilty state must be made instantly., I hope that the OSCE members will listen to the Ukrainian appeal., I had a call with the President of Israel. I informed him about the consequences of the Russian energy terror, about the needs of our state in view of this., Ukrainian initiatives to overcome the food crisis created by Russia were also discussed. I invited Israel to join our “Grain from Ukraine” humanitarian project., And, by the way, we already have specific agreements with different countries, different leaders, how to make this initiative of ours to supply food to the poorest countries truly global. Soon we will present all the details., And one more thing., Today, another 50 Ukrainian warriors were freed from Russian captivity. Two officers, 48 privates and sergeants. 15 of them were captured in the Kyiv region, on the territory of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. Seven were captured on Zmiinyi Island. Finally they will all be home., I am grateful to Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Malyuk, Lubinets and everyone who helps., And we will do absolutely everything possible and impossible to return every Ukrainian man and woman who are still being held by the occupiers., I thank everyone who supports Ukraine in this extremely difficult time!, Thank you to everyone who fights and works for our country!, We endured nine months of the full-scale war and Russia hasn’t found a way to break us. And it will not find it. We must continue to hold on like this in the future! In unity and helping each other., Glory to Ukraine!"
24 November 2022  - 13:59 ,I urge you to do everything possible so that the OSCE becomes a co-creator of the victory over Russian terror - President during his speech at the OSCE PA,", Dear Madam President,, Dear Speakers of the Sejm and Senate of Poland,, Ladies and Gentlemen!, Thank you for the opportunity to address you., Today is exactly 9 months from the day when Russia started a criminal and unprovoked full-scale war against Ukraine., Our country is showing unprecedented bravery by destroying the army of the occupier, who was bragging that he was allegedly the second most powerful in the world., Most of the countries of the world are showing strong solidarity, helping us free our land from occupation and protecting our people from Russia's genocidal policy., We see various international platforms finding the necessary solutions to help stop Russian terror, isolate the terrorist state as much as possible, and find a way out of the brutal global crises created by Russia., But why is there still no OSCE among these platforms? Why, in particular, is a terrorist state even after 9 months of its continuous crimes still a member of your Parliamentary Assembly?, If it was not for the Polish decision regarding visas for the Russian delegation, for which I am grateful to Poland, grateful to the representatives of the Polish Sejm, the government, and also the President, so if it was not for this, the representatives of the terrorist state could be among you today. This fact is an open mockery of all the principles on the basis of which the OSCE was created., Russia uses massive missile strikes against peaceful cities. It is trying to leave millions of people without electricity, communication, heat and water. It is trying to turn millions of Ukrainians into refugees who would seek refuge in other countries - in your countries. Every day and every night for nine months, Russia has been shelling the cities it can reach with artillery and MLRS..., And you all know very well that the current owners of Russia would like to do the same thing they are doing with Ukraine with other neighboring countries, too. They would love to if they could., If Ukraine had not stopped their aggressive ambitions. If the world had not shown solidarity., But the world was not looking for a meaningless compromise - all minus one - to fight Russian terror. So why should you be looking for that kind of compromise here? If obsolete regulations are designed to protect only false ideas about security and cooperation in Europe and do not really protect life and people, one cannot remain hostage to such procedures and regulations. Determination is required to change them., I urge you not to wait for winter, spring or summer to finally remove even the hypothetical possibility for supporters of terror to participate in any activity of your parliamentary assembly., I urge you to do everything you can to ensure that the OSCE is among those who are truly able to stop terror and help bring Russian murderers and torturers to justice. If you can act effectively at the level of your national parliaments, then the parliamentary assemblies must be able to act too - and not only at the level of verbal condemnations., Russia's war against Ukraine is a test for any international organization. Is it relevant or not? Is it capable of anything other than texts about what is happening, or not? Is it present among those who bring peace, or does it only care about how to preserve itself in its offices and halls?, Russia does not read letters about peace and does not listen to statements about the Helsinki principles. Russia does not consider the presence of any Council in Europe as a value. Russia does not respect the Red Cross and will not obey just because some organization has been working for over a hundred years., You have to be where the greatest danger is, if your calling is to take care of safety. It is necessary to make effective decisions that have legal consequences for the enemies of a united Europe, if your task is to protect Europe. You have to fight for every person where a person is in the worst danger, you have to fight for access to such people, to really save them, if your task is to protect people., We see in Ukraine who really helps, and who perceives Russian terror as part of the television picture. We see who is trying for the sake of peace to break everything that stands in the way, and who is pretending that this is some kind of online genocide - watching and waiting for Russia to stop on its own at some point or for someone to somehow press the ""pause"" button. We see who shows humanity saving people, and who quietly thinks that Ukrainians can simply be sacrificed., We see it all. The world sees it. And there will definitely be conclusions., Conclusions about specific leaders who were afraid of true leadership. Conclusions regarding specific international organizations that opposed themselves to the movement of history. Conclusions about specific countries, which, unfortunately, were shackled by fear. Right now, and precisely on the basis of actions or lack of actions during the Russian terrorist war, the fate of many in the world is being determined., And I urge you to do everything possible so that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe becomes a co-creator of the victory over Russian terror, and therefore a co-creator of peace on our continent., I am grateful for the principled Presidency of the Assembly and for the conscientious work in the committees and at the level of national delegations - for all that serves to protect our values and helps isolate Russia for terror. And I urge to extend this principledness and conscientiousness to the procedural architecture of the Assembly and to the OSCE in general. The time has come for this reform!, And, of course, in order to finally stop counting months of war and start counting the years of peace, it is necessary to use all national and international opportunities to put pressure on the terrorist state. Be leaders in this - and you will be leaders of the movement towards peace., Thank you for your attention!, Thank you to everyone for supporting Ukraine!, I believe that we will restore peace!, Glory to Ukraine!"
24 November 2022  - 00:33 ,"Energy workers, utility workers, State Emergency Service will work round the clock; we are gradually connecting new and new districts - address by the President of Ukraine",", Ukrainians!, Indomitable people of an indomitable country!, I’ve just addressed the UN Security Council and called for a reaction. Reaction to Russian terror. One seat in the Security Council is still occupied, and they tried to say something from there. I am sure that no one in the world wants to hear Russian lies anymore. In reality, this chair is empty., Today, the European Parliament recognized Russia as a terrorist state and called on the EU and member states to create a legal framework so that such a recognition works at the national level throughout Europe and has consequences – precisely legal consequences, not just political ones., And Russia - as if the whole world does not matter - continued its missile attacks today., The United States of America has announced another package of support in the amount of 400 million dollars. Everything necessary so that we can protect the life and freedom of our people., And Russia used missiles for another attack on another hospital and killed... a baby. Life that lasted only two days was cut short., Today, we are deploying Points of Invincibility across the country to support our people. To provide heat, electricity and communication., And Russia spends 67 missiles to hit the very basis of life of any people anywhere in Ukraine and provokes a blackout in Ukraine., When I received reports in the evening on the progress of power restoration, 11 regions were marked ""the entire region is without electricity""., As of the beginning of the night, we are gradually connecting new and new districts. Energy workers, utility workers, and State Emergency Service will work round the clock., The Kyiv region - the connection of household consumers has begun, 20% are already connected., The Chernihiv region is in a difficult situation, but we are looking for opportunities to provide electricity to people., The Cherkasy region - all critical infrastructure is working, we are doing everything to return energy to household consumers., The Odesa region - water supply is 100% connected, heat - 100%, household electricity consumers - still few, only 10%. But there should be more by morning., Volyn - tens of thousands of consumers are connected, we are working on all others., The Ternopil region - we are connecting district by district., The Lviv region was completely turned off. As of now, 90% are connected., Kyiv is in a very difficult situation. Work will continue throughout the night. We expect the result by tomorrow, in the first half of the day., It is the same in all other cities and communities that were affected or were left without energy. We are doing everything for the people., And the occupiers are doing everything to make people suffer, so that we can't even hear and see each other., Today, our team managed to bring home another 36 Ukrainians. 35 servicemen, one civilian. Two officers, 33 privates and sergeants. In spite of everything, we are saving our people and we will certainly return all the prisoners and deportees., This shows everything very clearly - about us and about them. It shows everything very accurately. The Russian occupiers still haven’t understood that they have only today. And we definitely have tomorrow., And I thank everyone who ensures that with their courage and their effectiveness!, Glory to Ukraine!"
24 November 2022  - 00:15 ,Ukraine proposes to adopt a resolution condemning energy terror - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the meeting of the UN Security Council convened after the missile strikes of the Russian Federation,", Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen!, We expect a strong reaction from the world to today's Russian terror. We expect the reaction of partners. We expect the reaction of friends - not just observers. We expect the reaction of all those who really recognize the UN Charter., We are doing everything possible. Ukraine presented the Peace Formula. The world heard it., 10 points - how to restore the full power of the UN Charter violated by Russia, and guarantee the safety of Ukraine, the safety of Europe and all the peoples of the planet who suffer from the consequences of Russian aggression., In response to our Peace Formula, Russia is following the steps of its formula of terror., The very next day after I proposed the Ukrainian Peace Formula at the G19 summit in Indonesia, we received ten Russian missiles per each point of the Peace Formula. , The strikes continued., We liberated Kherson - and as soon as the Russian army fled from there, it began to methodically destroy this city. Strikes every day., This night – another missile attack on the Zaporizhzhia region, on the hospital – on the buildings where the maternity ward was located. Russian terrorists took the life of a baby - the child was 2 days old when it was killed by a Russian missile!, And then again - dead, dead, dozens of wounded. In the city of Vyshhorod this afternoon, a residential building was hit, 35 people were injured, 4 were killed., This is one of the main points of the Russian formula of terror - missiles., Only today - almost 70 missiles. Against our energy infrastructure., Unfortunately, a residential building was also hit., Hospitals, schools, transport, residential areas - everything was affected., Russian terror led to a blackout – and not only in Ukraine. The light also went out in neighboring Moldova., But the understanding of what Russia wants to achieve with such strikes should not disappear anywhere in the world., Energy terror is an analogue of the use of weapons of mass destruction., When the temperature is below zero outside, and tens of millions of people are left without electricity, heat and water as a result of Russian missiles hitting energy facilities, this is an obvious crime against humanity., , Ladies and Gentlemen!, Among you are representatives of a state that offers nothing to the world except terror, destabilization and disinformation. Any Russian formulas do not provide for anything else., And that's why I emphasize once again - it's time to support the Ukrainian Peace Formula!, There must be no opportunity left for terror in the world!, That is why we are turning to our partners for support to protect our skies. We need modern and effective air defense and missile defense systems, and I thank everyone who is already helping., What can a representative of a terrorist state tell you now? That civilians do not suffer from their missiles? Everything is obvious. It's all too obvious., And I urge you to take concrete steps to protect humanity and life!, Russia has long been trying to turn the UN Security Council into a platform for rhetoric. But the Security Council was created as the world's most powerful platform for decisions and actions. This is what we can demonstrate., The Security Council should provide a clear assessment of the actions of the terrorist state in accordance with Chapter Seven of the UN Charter. Ukraine proposes that the Security Council adopt such a resolution condemning any forms of energy terror., Let's see if anyone in the world will be able to say, along with Russia, that terror against civilians is supposedly a good thing., I confirm the invitation from Ukraine regarding the mission of UN experts to critical infrastructure facilities of our country that have been or may be hit by Russian missiles., It is necessary to give a proper assessment of damage and destruction. It should be stated that these are strikes against the very infrastructure that ensures the lives of tens of millions of people., And finally, justice must be restored within the UN structures themselves., The terrorist state should not participate in any voting on the issues of its aggression, its terror., It is a stalemate when the one who caused the war, the one responsible for the terror, blocks any attempt by the UN Security Council to fulfill its mandate., This is nonsense that the veto right is reserved for the one who is waging a criminal war., It is necessary to lead the world out of this impasse., It is absolutely possible., The world should not be held hostage by one international terrorist., Russia is doing everything to make the electric generator a more powerful and necessary tool than the UN Charter. We must and can return real meaning to all things - and above all to the UN Charter., Your decisions are needed!, Thank you for the opportunity!, Thank you for your attention!, Glory to Ukraine!"
22 November 2022  - 22:47 ,"Across the country, we are rolling out a new ""Points of Invincibility"" project to support people - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, We have some much needed financial news today. First, there is another tranche of macro-financial aid from the European Union worth 2.5 billion euros. It is very important. We are also waiting for the approval of the macro-financial aid program for the next year in the amount of 18 billion euros., Second, the United States of America has announced that it will soon provide $4.5 billion in additional funding to directly support our budget., I am grateful to the partners for these important steps of solidarity. Due to such decisions of our friends, we maintain social stability and, despite all the Russian strikes, fulfill our social obligations. And these are obligations to millions of people., Since the beginning of the full-scale war, we have been making stable payments to pensioners - that's almost 11 million older Ukrainians. Indexation of pensions was carried out, as provided by law. 6 million citizens have some form of social support., This month alone, social payments totaled almost 14 billion hryvnias. This is assistance to those with many children, the poor, single mothers, and people with disabilities. Also more than 2 million internally displaced persons receive assistance from the state. Plus salaries for employees of the budget sector. We do everything to ensure payments for all our defenders., The financial frontline for Ukraine is now as important as the frontline on the battlefield., And I thank everyone who helps our state accumulate the necessary funds. Both to our friends in the world and to businesses that, despite everything, continue to work and pay taxes., As for the energy frontline. Energy and utility workers in many regions continue restoration of the network. We are also preparing responses to possible new terrorist attacks against our energy system., As of this evening, only stabilizing shutdown schedules are used in 16 regions and in Kyiv. But we must understand that in case of consumption spikes, emergency shutdowns are also possible., We are also rolling out our new ""Points of Invincibility"" project to support people across the country. As of this day, more than 4,000 such points have already been prepared. More are planned., If massive Russian strikes take place again and if there is an understanding that the electricity supply cannot be restored within hours, the work of ""Points of Invincibility"" will be activated - all basic services will be there, including electricity, mobile communications and the Internet, heat, water, and a first-aid kit. Absolutely free and 24/7., Points will necessarily work at all regional and district administrations, as well as at schools, buildings of the State Emergency Service, etc., A special website, nezlamnist.gov.ua, with a map of such points throughout the country is already available. It is constantly updated., It's important to see now where these points are in your city, in your community, and keep an eye on the map for updates in the coming weeks as new points are added., On the website and in all ""Points of Invincibility"" you will be able to find out where the nearest gas station, bank, pharmacy and grocery store are operating., All of us must be prepared for any scenario, considering what terrorists are fighting against our people and what they are trying to do., Local authorities are tasked with informing people about the existence of ""Points of Invincibility"". It should be very simple: in government buildings, in pharmacies, grocery stores, in post offices, there should be information about where a person can find support in the event of a long-term power outage., And it is very important that conscientious business is already joining this initiative of ours. Thanks to all the entrepreneurs who decided to support society now and make their business facilities also ""Points of Invincibility"" - with generators, Starlinks, water and other stuff., And please note that on our website nezlamnist.gov.ua there is a special form for business representatives who want to join and become a ""Point of Invincibility"" for Ukrainians. I am sure: by helping each other, we will all be able to get through this winter together., The situation on the frontline has not changed over the past day. In all areas of the front, the same dynamics as in the previous days is maintained., Donetsk region - fierce attacks, constant shelling. I thank all our heroes, who courageously hold out despite everything!, Luhansk region - with battles yet little by little we are strengthening our position and moving forward little by little., Kherson region and other territories of the south - we are doing everything to reduce the combat potential of the occupiers and eliminate their ability to carry out shelling of our cities., Step by step, we will bring the Russian army to new defeats, and no shelling of Kherson or any of our cities will help the occupiers., The sea... On our United24 fundraising platform, we are actively raising funds for naval drones. Unity, as always, gives a great result. Ordinary people. More than 50 Ukrainian companies. International businesses. Plus our Lithuanian friends. Plus the IT community. In total, people from 93 countries joined this initiative of ours! We are gradually building the Ukrainian fleet of naval drones!, I thank everyone who supports us!, Thank you to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine!, Thank you to everyone who helps loved ones get through this difficult time!, Glory to Ukraine!"
22 November 2022  - 18:50 ,"Aid to Ukraine today is not just a matter of equipment, it is protection against terror - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the 104th Congress of Mayors and Heads of Municipalities of France",", Dear friends!, It is an honor for me to address the Congress of Mayors, which unites now and always many leaders of French society. I know that I will be heard by senators and deputies of the French parliament, government ministers, prefects, heads of cities and municipalities, the President of the French Republic., You represent millions of French citizens, and I want to explain today what is most important now for millions of Ukrainians., I will be as specific as possible., The Russian war hit the entire territory of Ukraine, but the occupiers temporarily managed to seize part of the territory of ten of our regions., What are the 10 regions of Ukraine? These are more than 11,000 settlements. Of these 11 thousand, just imagine, the total number of cities and villages of Ukraine that came under occupation is more than three thousand seven hundred., These are big cities and small towns. Both ancient powerful settlements and villages with only a few houses., It was a very different life. But now we see one thing in all these settlements - a complete lack of any opportunities to live normally and freely., We managed to liberate more than 1,800 settlements from the Russian occupation. And the consequences of the occupation are very similar everywhere., The Russian soldiers mined everything they managed to mine. The occupiers looted everything they managed to loot. In general, hundreds of thousands of buildings were destroyed or damaged by shelling across Ukraine. Thousands of social objects. The occupiers leave behind a completely destroyed infrastructure..., Imagine what it is like - people under the occupation have lived without communication, electricity, normal water supply for six months., I will give an example of one city - Kherson., This is a city in the south of Ukraine. Regional center, port., Kherson, like the entire region, has become a new home for many residents of Crimea who left the peninsula after its capture by Russia in 2014., The Russian army occupied Kherson in the spring of this year. On November 11, the liberation of the city began., What did we see in it?, Of the three hundred thousand citizens who lived in Kherson before, about one hundred thousand remained in the city., They had nothing., There was no electricity or communication. There was no water. Only after our return did pharmacies start working in the city. We are resuming the work of the medical sphere, the provision of social services., The Russian military did not just rob people, taking away everything valuable..., They broke or destroyed all equipment that could work to restore communication and supplies for people, for example, heat in the winter., They mined administrative buildings, and some of them simply have to be blown up, because it is impossible to demine them without risking the lives of sappers., Kherson has always been a peaceful and tranquil southern city. Now we will have to spend years to heal its wounds after the Russian occupation., And in general, there are still about two thousand towns and villages that we still have to liberate and restore. At least dozens of them were completely destroyed by the strikes of the Russian army - like Mariupol or Volnovakha., Dear friends!, When Ukraine asks for help in this war, it is not just about the clash of states - it is not just about the fact that Russia has come to take our land and our resources, which it wants to appropriate., This is a clash of two opposite attitudes towards people and towards life., When Russia comes to a city, nothing is left of normal life there. , Russia brings repression and abuse, takes not just property from people... There are thousands of examples, in particular, of how the Russian military simply destroyed residential buildings or cars on the roads., There are thousands of proofs that mining and destroying energy, medical, educational and other infrastructure in Ukraine is a deliberate Russian policy., They want Ukrainians to simply not be able to live on this land., When the Ukrainian flag returns to the liberated territory, we do everything so that normal life returns with it. The same life you are used to in your cities., That is why Ukraine is so grateful to everyone who supports us - our defense, finances, reconstruction. , It is literally a life saving aid., Now, on the eve of winter, we are facing one of the greatest threats since the beginning of all-out war. Russian missile terror destroyed almost half of our energy infrastructure. And we know that the Kremlin has set the task of continuing the attacks on energy facilities. To turn the cold of winter into a weapon of mass destruction., With this, Russia wants to do to the entire territory of Ukraine what it is doing to the occupied cities and villages. It wants to destroy life., Of course, we oppose that., Just yesterday, I spoke with President Emmanuel Macron about what we can do together to defend against these Russian tactics., We have clear agreements., In particular, about holding in early December a conference on the rapid reconstruction of Ukraine already now - in accordance with our Plan for the rapid recovery of Ukraine. And I invite all of you to join the Conference and related efforts., I invite you to also contact the Embassy of Ukraine in France to find out what other options of help exist., In order to get through this winter and not allow Russia to turn the cold into a tool of terror and subjugation, we need many things - from generators of various capacities to Starlinks., For us, this is not just a matter of equipment. For Ukraine, this is protection against terror., Just like help with demining or equipment for firefighters and rescuers, for our doctors, which is already provided at the level of French cities and municipalities, the provision of generators and specific communication systems is an absolutely clear protection of people., I urge you to be very specific as well! Specific in help. And to support the protection of our cities and communities against terror. Together we can definitely do it., I thank you for your attention!, Thank you for your support!, Glory to Ukraine!"
21 November 2022  - 22:10 ,We now have a historic opportunity to protect the Ukrainian freedom once and for all - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, First of all, it should be said that today is the professional holiday of our paratroopers - the Day of Airborne Assault Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine., I'm in a relevant gift. The boys handed it over and asked to wear it. It’s my pleasure!, In particular, this is the day of the 25th Sicheslav Separate Airborne Brigade, the 80th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, the 81st Separate Airmobile Brigade and the 95th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, which distinguished themselves during the liberation of the Kharkiv region and our other lands., This is the day of the 46th Separate Airmobile Brigade, which took part in the liberation of Kherson and the occupied territories of the left bank of Ukraine. The day of the 79th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, which extremely bravely defends our state in the Luhansk region and the Donetsk region., This is the day of units of the 132nd Іeparate Reconnaissance Battalion, which took part in the liberation of the Zhytomyr region and Kyiv region together with other units of the Airborne Assault Troops., The day of the warriors of the 148th Separate Artillery Division who every day accurately ""subtract"" the enemy in the most threatening areas of the front., This is the day of the 71st Separate Hunting Brigade, which became part of the Airborne Assault Troops recently, but has already proven itself well., I thank you all, warriors! Thank you to all Ukrainian paratroopers!, In the morning, in the White Hall of the Heroes of Ukraine in the Mariyinsky Palace, I had the honor of presenting awards on the occasion of the professional holiday to the best fighters. I handed over the Gold Star Orders to the relatives of our Heroes who gave their lives for Ukraine., Our Airborne Assault Troops, like all the Defense Forces of Ukraine, pay an extremely high price for our people to preserve their freedom. Thousands of Ukrainian men and women died fighting for our country. We should always remember them. We must always honor their courage and self-sacrifice., I spoke today about Ukraine's contribution to the protection of freedom and European values in an address to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly., I called on the countries of the Alliance to take specific actions to implement the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which can reliably guarantee peace and justice for Ukraine and the entire Euro-Atlantic community., I also called on all parliaments of NATO member states to finally adopt a decision on designating Russia as a terrorist state. I believe that gradually we will reach this result - this is how Russia will be perceived in the world. Exactly what it has become. A terrorist state., And I thank all the members of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, who today adopted the relevant resolution to confirm this and our other positions., Today I spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron about the implementation of several points of our Peace Formula at once. Namely, about radiation safety and the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as well as about the energy security of Ukraine and Europe., We are working to ensure the implementation of the IAEA order to stop any hostile activity against Ukrainian nuclear facilities. And for this, the demilitarization of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is extremely important. Russia must withdraw all its militants from there and stop shelling the station., I am grateful to Mr. President Macron for his willingness to support the protection of our energy facilities. We are also doing everything to make the conference on the reconstruction of Ukraine and the implementation of our Fast Recovery Plan, in which France is ready to show leadership, as effective as possible., Today, our energy workers had to apply not only stabilizing shutdowns, but also unscheduled ones. This is caused by a higher level of consumption than the country can provide at this time., Therefore, I would like to appeal to all representatives of regional authorities and local communities: please do not stop communicating about the rational consumption of electricity., Of course, energy workers, utility workers, rescuers and everyone involved are working at their maximum. But the systemic damage to our energy sphere by the attacks of Russian terrorists is so significant that all our people and businesses should be very frugal and spread consumption by hours of the day., As of this evening, the situation is particularly difficult in Kyiv and the region, as well as in the Vinnytsia, Sumy, Ternopil, Cherkasy, Odesa regions and some other cities and districts., Please try to limit your personal use of electricity in areas where there is the most difficulty on a daily basis, and especially during peak consumption hours. Of course, there should be a very frugal approach in public places as well., And one more thing., Today is the ninth anniversary of the beginning of Maidan - the Revolution of Dignity. Ninth... But the freedom and dignity of the Ukrainian people is more than a thousand years old. It is worth remembering this., There were many threats to the freedom of our people and the very existence of Ukrainians. But the people got through it. And now we have a historic opportunity to defend Ukrainian freedom once and for all., I believe that it will be so., I thank everyone who supports our country! Thank you to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! Eternal glory and honor to all those who gave their lives for the freedom of our people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
21 November 2022  - 16:53 ,"We must remain principled in countering Russian aggression, joint action is true peacekeeping - speech by the President of Ukraine at the annual session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly",", Dear Mr. President of the Assembly!, Dear attendees!, Dear representatives of Spain and all other countries of the Alliance!, Dear friends!, I am glad to see you and thank you for all the kind words that have just been spoken and will be spoken in the Assembly in our support - in support of the struggle for freedom., Today, Ukraine marks the ninth anniversary of the beginning of Maidan - the Revolution of Dignity. In those months of 2013-2014, when Ukrainians in the squares and streets of our cities defended the right to European choice for our state, an important thing happened for our entire community - a community of nations united by the values of freedom, respect for law, democracy and diversity., Ukrainians filled with a powerful life force what many began to think was just a bureaucratic formality. Ukrainians and all people in Europe, in America, in the world, who supported us and continue to support us, filled the flag of the European Union with new energy. And in fact, with the way we defend freedom in Ukraine, we united both the European Union and NATO. We showed the commonality of challenges and proved the commonality of values., Ladies and Gentlemen!, Although Ukraine has not yet become a full-fledged part of the EU and NATO, I am addressing you on behalf of the people who have always been, are and will be part of the valuable space to which you all belong. History brought us to different sides of ideological walls. But the walls fell, and our values are all preserved., And not only me, but millions of our people and the majority of citizens of your states support the European and Euro-Atlantic integration of Ukraine. Now, when we are defending European values ​​not in the squares and streets, but on the battlefield in a full-scale war, it is absolutely obvious how unfair and unnatural Ukraine's alienation from Europe was. We will not leave a single percent of that alienation., I urge you to do everything in your power so that our community of nations - nations of values - will never again be divided or weakened!, All of you see what endangers us. All of us! All who cannot imagine their life without freedom. All of you can see Ukraine’s significant contribution to the protection of our community. Everyone sees how important it is that we really united in defense after February 24., So, due to this, you also see that Ukraine should become a full member of the European Union and NATO. And I urge you to support our applications for membership in the EU and the Alliance!, Ukrainians do not just believe - Ukrainians are sure that we can defend ourselves in this war and return the borders of a united Europe to the entire length of our eastern and southern borders. Ukrainians do not just believe - Ukrainians know that the strength of our democracy will be a guarantee that no tyranny to the east of us will be able to threaten Europe., But in order to realize all these years, to realize all this, we have to use all the strength of our community, all the potential of our cooperation in order to gradually stop this terrorist Russian war and restore peace., That is why I proposed the Ukrainian Peace Formula. All points of our Peace Formula are beyond doubt., Every nation in our community is interested in ensuring that no dangerous incidents occur at nuclear facilities. We all want Russian terrorists to no longer be able to take people's lives. Each of our states needs guaranteed protection against any Russian missiles and any sabotage against infrastructure facilities. We are all interested in the stability of energy, food and other markets. We all strive for international law to retain its force and actually work. Each of us considers it fair that those guilty of war crimes, deportations and any manifestations of genocidal policy should be brought to justice. We all wish there would be no burnt cities and ruins instead of a normal life anywhere in Europe., All this is ensured by the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which, without being mistaken, can be called both the European peace formula and the world peace formula, as it is built on respect and protection of universal human values, on international law. From nuclear safety to the restoration of our territorial integrity, from the Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine to countering ecocide - everything is envisaged in our Formula., Dear friends!, I suggest that you and your countries choose the point of the peace formula in which you can show your leadership. Joint action is what constitutes true peacemaking., And while we concentrate our forces to implement this Formula, we must maintain one hundred percent principled position in countering Russian aggression. Russia has bet on a genocidal policy, and that is why it is destroying our energy infrastructure. To ""kill"" electricity, water and heat supply in winter - and this is Russia's goal - is to put the lives of millions of people in direct danger. This is equivalent to the use of weapons of mass destruction - an absolute crime., Therefore, it will be right if you in your parliaments designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, as the parliaments of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and the Czech Republic have done. It will be right if your countries constantly strengthen sanctions against Russia, which has become the complete opposite of our community and the most anti-European power in the world. It is the constant strengthening of sanctions that will not allow the terrorist state to adapt and find new ways of ensuring its terror. A new, ninth sanctions package of the European Union is needed, new world sanctions against Russia for terror - immediately after limiting export prices for Russian energy resources., It will be right if we prevent Russia's key terrorist plan and provide Ukraine with full protection of the sky. When Russian missiles, Iranian drones, and any other instruments of terror fail to reach their intended targets, Russia will have to do what we need, namely, follow our Peace Formula., We can ensure this! But for this, Ukraine needs to be provided with a sufficient number and quality of air defense and missile defense systems. With a sufficient weight of defense and financial support. The terrorist state must see that it stands no chance., Since 2013 and until today, Ukrainians, with the support of our friends, have demonstrated that nothing is impossible for us when we are truly united and defend our unconditional values. So, let's maintain our unity! And let’s fight for freedom!, I thank all of you for your support!, Long live freedom!, Glory to Ukraine!"
21 November 2022  - 09:01 ,Address by the President of Ukraine on the Day of Dignity and Freedom,", Fellow Ukrainians!, Today we celebrate the Day of Dignity and Freedom. A holiday that shows that for us dignity and freedom is a holiday. The answer to the question of who Ukrainians are and what is most important to them., Dear people!, I said these words in the same place on the same day exactly one year ago. What has changed since then? A lot. In our country, Europe and the whole world. But something remains unchanged. This is the answer to the question of who Ukrainians are and what is most important to us. Two values, inextricably intertwined, like the right and left banks of the Dnipro River. Like blue and yellow colors. Like Chubynsky’s words and Verbytsky’s music. Like two threads of a pattern on a vyshyvanka where our genetic code is encrypted. This is dignity and freedom., We always remembered this and have no right to forget. We always valued this and are not afraid to defend this. We always knew what we wanted. And this year, everyone found out what we are capable of. Friends and enemies saw it. Allies and partners. We saw for ourselves. Someone - once again. Someone - for the first time. But all together we proved and continue to prove that dignity and freedom are a holiday for us. This remained unchanged. And everyone saw what Ukrainians are capable of., Everyone saw what defenders we have. How to hold out against one of the greatest armies in the world and become one of the best armies in the world. Someone will say: it sounds loud. Yes. Our army sounds loud. For the last eight years. And for the last nine months. When hardened fighters are joined by musicians, actors, Olympic champions, IT specialists, scientists, businessmen. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who did not get on the plane, but stood in line at the military commissariat. And side by side they stood up for our dream. Free Ukraine forever., And everyone saw what our civilians are capable of. Everyone saw what kind of citizens we have! How can you become a living wall on the path of the occupier's military columns, stop and turn around enemy tanks and armored personnel carriers with bare hands. Go to rallies under the occupation despite the gunshots and stun grenades. Preserve the Ukrainian flag and wait to finally meet the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Flood your village to prevent the orcs from entering Kyiv., Shoot down a Russian drone with a can. Give seeds to the occupiers so that sunflowers sprout in the place where they perish., And everyone saw what kind of doctors, firefighters, rescuers, railway workers, energy workers, and farmers we have. How can you be on duty for several weeks in a row. Pull dozens of wounded from the battlefield. Carry out surgeries under bombs and bullets. Sow a crop and gather it as a harvest under bombs and bullets. Give lectures to students online, in the trenches. Get a bachelor's degree online, in the trenches., Everyone saw what kind of volunteers and caring people we have. How can you raise funds for drones, ambulance vehicles, optics, thermal imagers in a matter of hours. How to get everything. Buy everything. Bring everything. And then get, buy and bring again, because that wasn't all. And in every village, people canned borscht and stewed meat for the frontline, because we would go red with embarrassment if our warriors ate expired dry ration, like orcs., We are willing to give the last we have so that the Ukrainian warrior looks decently. Fights decently. Wins decently. And everyone saw what kind of business we have. Not oligarchs, but a modern, creative, humane and responsible business. How to turn your office, hotel or gym into a shelter for IDPs. How fashion shoe brands manufacture army boots. Designers of women's dresses manufacture body armor. A garden furniture manufacturer makes anti-tank hedgehogs. A famous model cooks food for warriors and refugees. A TV presenter makes a ""Bandera smoothie"". A doctor of science sorts humanitarian aid in Poland. And an opera singer evacuates hundreds of people in his car., Everyone saw what kind of children we have. How they give up smartphones and gadgets to donate money to the army. How they wash cars and sell drawings, collecting money for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. How a boy runs away from home to enroll in the territorial defense. How a girl with shot legs drives a car 15 kilometers to take out four wounded adults., Everyone saw what kind of people we have! Willing to give the last. Willing to stand to the last. They did not lose dignity. Bravery. Faith in themselves. And they united. In order not to lose freedom. Not to lose independence. Not to lose Ukraine., We can be left without money. Without gasoline. Without hot water. Without light. But not without freedom. And it remains unchanged., Yes, we have paid and continue to pay a very high price for freedom. And we will never forget all those who gave their lives for Ukraine. And we will never forgive everyone who took away their lives and wanted to take away our freedom. But the main thing is that no one succeeded and no one will ever succeed., Dear people!, I said these words in the same place on the same day exactly one year ago. What has changed since then? A lot. Craters appeared on our land. There are roadblocks and anti-tank hedgehogs in our cities and villages. It may be dark on our streets. It may be cold in our homes. There are many changes, but they have not changed the most important thing. Because the most important thing is not outside, but inside. And it remains unchanged. And that's why we will hold out. We will endure., Everyone. Different. But Ukrainian men and women. Defenders. Everyone who knows: we must be worthy, we must not give up. Because Ukrainians are not used to giving up. Because they have dignity. And therefore - freedom!, This remains unchanged. We will overcome everything. Endure. Survive. Prevail!, And on the Day of Dignity and Freedom, we will gather on Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Where dignity and freedom have always been protected. On the granite, on the barricades during the Orange Revolution and the Revolution of Dignity. Where we celebrated the 30th anniversary of Ukraine's independence. And where we will celebrate the Victory Day of Ukraine. In a peaceful Kyiv, in a peaceful Ukraine, I will speak about the important. About the main thing. What remained unchanged. And will remain unchanged., Glory to Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
20 November 2022  - 21:19 ,This year the world saw how important the contribution of Ukrainians to global food security is – address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, This day is coming to an end - already the 270th day of the full-scale war. I will report briefly., The first topic is the frontline. The fiercest battles, as before, are in the Donetsk region. Although there are fewer attacks today due to the deterioration of the weather, the number of Russian shelling occasions remains, unfortunately, extremely high., Luhansk region - little by little we are moving forward with battles. As of now, there have been almost 400 shelling occasions in the east since the beginning of the day. Thank you to each and everyone who holds positions and helps our defense forces., South - we are holding the line, consistently and very calculatedly destroying the potential of the occupiers., The second topic is energy. Restoration of networks and technical supply capabilities, demining of power transmission lines, repairs - everything goes on round the clock., We managed to alleviate the situation in some regions where there were a lot of real problems yesterday. This evening there are stabilization shutdowns in 15 regions and in Kyiv as well. The largest are Vinnytsia, Sumy, Poltava, Khmelnytskyi, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv regions and the capital. We are doing everything possible and impossible to return normal life to Odesa, Kharkiv and all our cities and communities., And I thank all energy workers, utility workers, regional administrations - everyone who works for the sake of Ukrainians., The third topic is foreign policy. Today I addressed the participants of the summit of the International Organization of La Francophonie. These are more than 50 participating countries, and more than 20 observer countries. Africa, Asia, America, Europe - everywhere they hear Ukraine, everywhere they know our proposals on how to restore peace to Ukraine and how to restore stability to the world., I will say right away that the Ukrainian peace formula is perceived extremely positively in the world. It is quite constructive and realistic - in contrast to the empty and mendacious Russian rhetoric about their alleged readiness for some kind of negotiations., We will do everything to make the world accept the Ukrainian peace formula., There will be several important international addresses in the upcoming week. And we are already preparing., And one more thing., Traditionally, the Day of Agricultural Workers is celebrated in Ukraine on the third Sunday of November. Was there ever an international context to this day? This year it’s definitely there., This year, many people in the world saw how important the contribution of Ukrainians to global food security is. The lives of millions of people in different countries directly depend on our agricultural sector., I thank all our people who work on the ground, who provide Ukraine and the world with the essentials. Thanks to you and your work, we can find support for our state in those countries with which we do not yet have traditional relations. But we will have them, trust me., Glory to all who fight for Ukraine!, Glory to everyone who works and helps!, Glory to Ukraine!"
20 November 2022  - 19:17 ,"Ukraine wants peace, but for its restoration we need support - President's address to the members of the International Organization of La Francophonie",", Dear friends!, Dear leaders!, I want to tell you now about a typical day in our country. Unfortunately, typical... And not through our fault. A day of this week., Ask yourself: what have you been busy with this Tuesday? What were you worried about? What did you feel?, For Ukraine, this Tuesday is almost a hundred missile strikes. A hundred different missiles against our cities. Against residential buildings. Against enterprises. Against power plants., Do you know what this missile strike is? It’s more than 20 million people without electricity. Such was the damage to the power system, such was the urgent emergency shutdown. The reactors at two of our nuclear power plants also shut down due to missile damage to the energy industry., Ladies and Gentlemen!, You all know what a terrible war Russia is waging against Ukraine. You all know how we want to restore peace. All of you could hear what we have to offer for this. The Ukrainian peace formula is very clear, and each of its points has been thoroughly worked out., Radiation and nuclear safety. Food security. Energy security. Release of all prisoners and deportees. Implementation of the UN Charter and restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the world order. Withdrawal of Russian troops and cessation of hostilities. Restoring justice. Countering ecocide. Prevention of escalation. Fixing the end of the war., Each of these points are specific decisions, what needs to be done for security. Russian aggression will not simply stop – stability and predictability will be restored for everyone in the world. That is why our formula for peace is a formula for peace for the world., And I suggest to all leaders, to all conscientious countries, to choose the element of the peace formula that you can help us implement., Ukraine really wants peace. But in order to restore peace, we need support. That is why I am turning to you now., Ukraine always helps. Dozens of countries in the world, whose security directly depends on cooperation with Ukraine, know this for sure., This year it was confirmed again. When Russia blocked the Black Sea and our ports, hundreds of millions of people in various countries found themselves on the brink of an acute food crisis. When we managed to restore our exports and return millions of tons of Ukrainian agricultural products to the food market, a sense of stability finally began to appear., That is why it is so important that we stop Russian aggression. This is not just about our country, which Russia is trying to take over. It's not just about our land and resources that Russia wants to appropriate., It's about something more. About stability for everyone in the world. This is about our common radiation safety - so that not a single Russian missile hits our nuclear power plants. This is about our common energy security - so that the destabilization of energy markets, which Russia uses as a weapon, finally stops. This is about our common food security - so that people have basic food on their tables. Peace in Ukraine is peace for you too., Today is the 270th day of the full-scale war. Russia used more than 4,700 missiles. Hundreds of our cities are simply burned. Thousands of people died. Hundreds of thousands were forcibly deported to Russia. Millions left Ukraine for other countries, fleeing the war., We have to stop it. We must stop Russian aggression., I always say this: the return of peace is possible! But it is possible when everyone in the world understands that no one in the world deserves a single day of terror., Thank you for your attention!, Thank you for your support!, Glory to Ukraine!"
19 November 2022  - 19:19 ,We will provide everything needed for our protection – address of President of Ukraine,", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, I briefly report on the day, which started very early today, it was very active, and my schedule for this day is not yet exhausted., I just held another meeting of the Staff. The main issues are the front. The provision of our troops, the situation in particular sections of the front line and that we are planning to increase the number of Ukrainian flags in the cities in the south and east of the country., The battles in Donetsk region were discussed separately. Reports were presented. We are doing everything to help our heroes withstand Russian attacks., Of course, special attention was paid to energy., The composition of the participants of the Staff meeting is traditional. The Commander-in-Chief, commanders and all who work for our defense., An extremely important visit to Ukraine took place today – the visit of the new British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak. A very meaningful visit. We managed to discuss all the key issues of our relations. There will be new results for both our countries – that's for sure., Thank you, Rishi, Mr. Prime Minister, for your willingness to defend freedom even more strongly with us. We also have some very necessary decisions – we agreed on them today., As always, today I received reports on restoration work in the energy sector., We are working throughout the country to stabilize the situation., The most problems with electricity are in the city of Kyiv and Kyiv region, the city of Odesa and Odesa region, the city of Kharkiv and Kharkiv region. Vinnytsia, Ternopil, Cherkasy, Chernihiv and other regions – energy workers are doing everything possible to give people a normal life., Kherson – we are restoring transport connections. There is the first train from Kyiv. We create new opportunities for people every day., We are preparing important international events – they will be soon. We will provide everything that is needed for our protection., We involve everyone who can be involved in supporting our state., Thank you to everyone who works for Ukraine!, Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine!, Thanks to everyone in the world who helps!, Glory to Ukraine!"
19 November 2022  - 09:53 ,"For peace to exist, we must make all elements of Russian aggression impossible - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the Halifax International Security Forum",", Dear friends!, Maybe most of the discussions at this year`s forum will address one question – how to end the Russian war. , But I will ask you to formulate a more precise question – how to restore real and just peace., Simply the end of the war does not guarantee peace. Russia is now looking for a short truce – a respite to regain strength. Someone may call this the war`s end. But such a respite will only worsen the situation., Any voiced ideas of our land`s concessions or of our sovereignty cannot be called peace. Immoral compromises will lead to new blood., A truly real, long-lasting and honest peace can only be the result of the complete demolition of Russian aggression., There are 10 items in the Ukrainian Peace Formula. These are challenges which should be overcome for the sake of security of Ukraine, Europe and the world. This is the Peace Formula for the world., Ukraine proposed precisely such a Peace Formula. I presented it to the UN General Assembly and the G20 Summit. And I am asking you to help us implement this formula! This is the only way to real peace., First item is radiation and nuclear safety. The second one is food security. The third is energy security. The fourth is the release of all war prisoners and deportees. The fifth is the implementation of the UN Charter and the restoration of our territorial integrity and world order. The sixth is the pull out of Russian troops and the end of hostilities. The seventh is the restoration of justice, namely the Tribunal for those guilty of aggression crime, and – damages compensation. The eighth is countering ecocide. Ninth are the security guarantees for Ukraine to prevent escalation. And the tenth is the confirmation of the war`s end., What is the goal of such approach? , We emphasize on all of the elements of Russian aggression, and offer our partners to demolish all aspects of aggression together with us in order to provide security. That is something where each of our partners can show their leadership., We have already succeeded in some things, for example, we extended the grain export initiative and offer a new humanitarian initiative – Grain From Ukraine to enhance food security., In the same way, we can go step by step in other items of our Peace Formula., I suggest you, dear Forum participants, to choose the possible leadership options for your countries. Each item of our Peace Formula has the proposals for particular solutions. Please choose which item you can help with., I believe that Canada, which strongly supports us, will also choose one of the Peace Formula items for itself and will show all the strength of its leadership., I assure you that peace is possible! But for it to exist, we must make impossible Russian aggression – all of its elements., Let it happen! Let there be peace!, Glory to Ukraine!"
18 November 2022  - 23:28 ,"Nowhere on the frontline do we give in to the enemy, in certain areas we are preparing future successes - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, All day long, the energy staff worked to restore the normal technical possibility of electricity supply, as a result today there are already significantly fewer emergency shutdowns., As of the evening, in most regions where shutdowns continue, stabilization hourly schedules were in effect. Emergency shutdowns were used to a greater extent in the Odesa region and Kyiv., The difficult situation with energy supply persists in a total of 17 regions and in the capital. Kyiv region and Kyiv, it’s very difficult in the Odesa region, and also the Vinnytsia region and Ternopil region., Special ""Points of Invincibility"" were opened in Kherson today. The first two points. There will be more., While electricity is restored in the city, people can charge their phones, stay warm, drink tea and get help. We have provided communication service there, there are ""Starlinks"", etc., We know that it is very difficult for people, because the occupiers destroyed everything before fleeing. But we will connect everything, restore everything., Vice-President of the European Commission Dombrovskis was in Kyiv today. We talked with him, in particular, about energy. Financial cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union, the financing needs of our country until the end of the year and in the next year were also discussed in detail., This year, we expect two tranches of macro-financial aid - EUR 2.5 billion in November and EUR 0.5 billion in early December., We also discussed new sanctions against Russia, which may be introduced at the European level., I spoke today with the student community of Ireland - a country that supports us fundamentally. Although it is a neutral country militarily, Ireland strongly defends European values and helps us politically and humanitarianly., I made two requests to the Irish. The first is to promote at the pan-European level the need to strengthen sanctions against Russia. The second is to help us spread the truth about the events in Ukraine and about Russian terror., I also addressed the participants of the security forum in Halifax, Canada, which is one of the world's security forums. Once again, I presented the Ukrainian peace formula and invited Canada and our other partners to choose for themselves a component of the peace formula in which they can show their leadership as much as possible., This is the point of the way we present our proposals for restoring peace., We have broken them down into elements - what Russian aggression consists of. And we do everything to neutralize each of these elements and to neutralize the aggressor because of it., Every day, I receive very positive feedback from the world about this approach of ours - major leaders support Ukrainian constructiveness. And I believe that we will be able to implement our peace formula., The fierce fighting in the Donetsk region continues to this day, there has been no alleviation of hostilities or respite. About a hundred Russian attacks were repelled in the Donetsk region only yesterday. All our warriors who are holding out in Donbas are true heroes., Today, I would like to pay particular attention to the border guards of the Kharkiv and Sumy detachments, who are currently operating in the Donetsk region. Their mortars help a lot, giving the invaders no rest. Nice job, guys! Thank you!, I also thank the warriors of the 4th operational brigade of the National Guard, which protects Ukraine in the direction of Bakhmut. Smart initiative and persistence are two things that produce extremely useful results., Nowhere on the frontline do we give in to the enemy. We respond everywhere, we hold positions everywhere. We are preparing future successes in certain areas., I spoke today with the President of Türkiye Erdoğan. Thanked him for the efforts to extend our grain export initiative., We also discussed the details of our new humanitarian initiative Grain from Ukraine. I hope that Türkiye will join its implementation., Of course, attention was paid to both security cooperation and energy situation., Tomorrow we will have a very active day, not a day off at all. We are expecting news and opportunities for Ukraine. And we are already preparing the appropriate soil for them., And today I want to say one more thing - congratulations. Congratulations to all sergeants of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on their professional day. Today, many kind words were said both in the army and in society., Sergeants are truly the people who ensure real unity and understanding between commanders and soldiers. The sergeant corps is the true backbone of the Army, and I thank all of our sergeants who live up to those words., Thank you to each and everyone who is currently serving in our defense forces!, Thank you to everyone who made the defense of Ukraine a part of their personal destiny!, Glory to our heroes!, Eternal memory and honor to those who gave their lives for the freedom of Ukrainians!, Glory to Ukraine!"
18 November 2022  - 18:20 ,"Russian aggression does not stop for a single day, so the pressure on Russia should not stop either, and everyone can do it at their own level - address by the President of Ukraine to the university community of Ireland",", Dear friends!, Mr. Minister, Mr. President, dear students!, I am glad to see you!, While preparing for this meeting, I learned that Russia has recently imposed sanctions against 52 political figures of your country., And for what? For the fact that your country supports European efforts to end Russian terror and to revive international law., Of course, the restrictions imposed by Russia do not particularly affect anything. This is more of a propaganda thing, so that on Russian television they can lie that Russia is allegedly capable of something in diplomacy., But after seeing this message about your 52 politicians, I remembered another number - 52, and a recent one too. And also the one that is related to sanctions., As you know, the summit of the countries with the largest economies just took place in Indonesia. And the participants of the summit agreed on a joint declaration - exactly 52 points. Quite meaningful - they reflect many existing global problems., Formally, Russia also supported the declaration, but in reality, it violates most of the things contained in the declaration. And some of the acute global problems that the ""twenty"" declares to solve are deliberately created by Russia., That is, after carefully reading these 52 points of the Bali Declaration, you can see why international pressure on Russia, particularly sanctions, should be not only maintained, but also intensified. Russia continues to destroy international relations and people's lives, and pretends that it is fighting against this destabilization together with everyone., This is from the fourth point of the declaration: ""It is important to uphold international law and the multilateral system that guarantees peace and stability... Today's era must not be an era of war."", And this is when Russia mobilized all resources to not only turn our time into a time of war, but to become the largest terrorist state in history., Point five of the declaration - Russia says that it will allegedly, together with others, take measures to promote energy stability and market stability., And at the same time, when this summit in Indonesia is still going on, Russia is carrying out a missile attack against our country. Almost a hundred missiles - specifically against the energy sphere. Another missile attack the next day. And not only against power plants, but also against gas production facilities. This is energy stability in Russian., The thirteenth point of the Bali Declaration is about combating climate change. Russia allegedly confirms the protection of the natural environment, but it has already destroyed almost three million hectares of forests in our country with its aggression! They were burned by shelling. And this is only one of thousands of crimes committed by Russia against the environment., Point 22 of the declaration - ""Countries will make every effort for timely access to vaccines, therapeutic and diagnostic tools."", And in fact, hundreds of hospitals were destroyed by Russian shelling. In most of the territory occupied by Russia, there is no access to medicine at all. Even to the simplest medicines, to surgical operations, to insulin... And this is in Europe. In 2022., And this is the case for almost all 52 points of the Bali Declaration. You read and see the scale of Russia’s lies and that it is now the biggest threat to the world., I will add point 44. It specifically states: ""Access to education is a human right and a key tool for inclusive and sustainable economic recovery."", Do you know how many educational institutions in Ukraine the Russian army destroyed in 9 months of war? 2,719 were shelled, and 332 were completely destroyed. These are universities, schools..., Dear friends!, Russian aggression does not stop for a single day. Just as Russian lies to the world never stop. Therefore, for all this, the international pressure on Russia should not stop for a single day. And this can be done not only by politicians, but also by everyone at their own level., Of course, new sanctions should be applied against Russia. It is effective. A new European sanctions package is needed. Please defend this need at the pan-European level., We must be active in spreading the truth about the war and the crises provoked by it. This is something that all of you can definitely do. Please talk about what is happening and find a format convenient for you to support honest media or bloggers who cover global affairs and, in particular, Russian aggression., And please look for specific projects that can help our defense and our people. The more collective efforts are made, the sooner we will force Russia to leave the territory of Ukraine and fulfill its obligations to the world., Thank you for your attention!, Thank you for your support, Ireland!, Glory to Ukraine!"
17 November 2022  - 22:19 ,"If the world works in unity, famine will be defeated – address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today we have important international results., Our export grain initiative has been extended. Despite all the difficulties, despite various manipulations by Russia, we will continue to export agricultural products through our Black Sea ports., This is a very specific thing that makes the world see the importance of Ukraine. Since August 1, more than 450 ships have already left the ports of Great Odesa. The total amount of food is 11 million tons. The geography is very broad: Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Yemen, Lebanon, Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Türkiye, as well as the countries of the European Union., Tens of millions of people, primarily in African countries, have been saved from starvation, in particular by means of deliveries in the framework of the UN World Food Programme from our ports., We also managed to reduce the pressure on the global food market. And this means that food prices are significantly lower than they would be without our food exports., We have done everything to expand this work. And I thank all our partners who are helping: the UN and Secretary-General Guterres personally, Türkiye and President Erdoğan personally. Thanks to everyone in our team who is responsible for this direction. This is a truly important result., Today, a meeting was held in the Office regarding our Grain from Ukraine initiative. We have the consent of such countries as Germany, Poland, Belgium, Japan, Türkiye and the USA to join the work of the initiative. But these are the countries that have already made up their mind. There will be more participating countries., The meaning is very simple and as specific as possible. All the countries of the world, together with Ukraine, can ensure the supply of food for those in the world who suffer the most from food shortages. We will provide more details on how this will work shortly., I believe that this Russian aggression should lead the whole world to an obvious conclusion: never again should there be mass famine in the world. If the world works in unity, famine will be defeated., A very important decision was adopted today in the Netherlands. There is the first sentence for the murderers who destroyed the Malaysian Boeing in the sky over Donbas in 2014. Three men were sentenced to life imprisonment. And the day will surely come when they will begin to serve this punishment., But this decision is not just about three murderers. Russia lied a lot about this catastrophe, but nevertheless the key facts were established. Now the perpetrators have been convicted and the basis is provided to convict the culprits of a higher level, too. Those who bear full personal responsibility for the crime of aggression against Ukraine - the original crime that gave rise to all the others committed by the Russists since 2014. , This is something without which it is impossible to protect the world from the repetition of such wars as Russian aggression against our state. When all the murderers and torturers are convicted, when their commanders and political ""cover"" face fair sentences, when Russia compensates for all the damage caused by Russian aggression, it will be a very solid foundation for a lasting peace., We have all the possibilities to ensure this. Every Russian war crime, every terrorist attack of theirs will receive its legal response. Today's decision in The Hague proves it., The elimination of the consequences of another missile attack against Ukraine continues all day..., Again, there are emergency shutdowns in addition to planned, stabilization ones. Currently, more than 10 million Ukrainians are without electricity. Most of them are in the Vinnytsia region, Odesa region, Sumy region and Kyiv. We are doing everything to normalize the supply., In Dnipro, dozens of people were injured as a result of a missile attack. Everyone is provided with aid., In Zaporizhzhia, the clearance of the rubble of a residential building, which was destroyed by Russian shelling at night, continues... The list of the dead includes seven people. Unfortunately, this number may increase., Only in the first half of today, our defense forces managed to shoot down six Russian cruise missiles and five Shaheds. Unfortunately, not all of those launched by terrorists., We repeat to our partners again and again that only full protection of the Ukrainian sky will protect both Ukraine and Europe from many possible escalations of Russian aggression and will definitely encourage Russia to truly end the war. Not to the kind of propaganda that now sounds from the Kremlin about the alleged readiness for negotiations in order to buy some time and gather forces for a new offensive, but to real peace., I would like to thank Finland and Sweden today for the decisions regarding the new defense assistance packages. This is very important. Each such decision of the states makes them co-creators of our victory and future peace., Today I signed several decrees on awarding our warriors. 402 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were honored with state awards., In total, since February 24, more than 32,000 Ukrainian men and women have been awarded for bravery in battles. 4950 of them - posthumously., We must always remember how many people gave their lives to save Ukraine and freedom., Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by Russian aggression!, Glory to all who gain victory for Ukraine!, Gratitude to everyone who helps us and works for the state!, Glory to Ukraine!"
17 November 2022  - 12:25 ,"The more forms of terror Russia will use in this war, the more money the world will spend on weapons and defense - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum",", Ladies and Gentlemen!, Thank you for your attention to Ukraine!, Our communication today actually finalizes the work of your Forum, it is symbolic., Symbolic, because the global situation directly depends on when and how the Russian aggression will end., Look at how many threats and crises for everyone in the world have been provoked by this aggression. I will give three examples now, but there are more - much more., Another Russian terrorist attack has just taken place, in the morning - dozens of missiles, civilian objects are the main target. Russia is fighting against electricity and heat for people, blowing up power plants and other energy facilities., This is everyday life in Ukraine now - because of Russian terror. That is why we put so much effort into getting modern air defense and anti-missile defense systems from our partners. Plus constant hostilities on the frontline more than a thousand kilometers long., What does this mean from a global perspective?, Instead of investing trillions of dollars in the development of human capital, the world will spend colossal amounts of money on rearmament - in addition to those already planned. You will see., Now everyone is paying close attention to how we defend ourselves in Ukraine. They look - which weapons are the best, which tactics work, which defense systems give the maximum result., To be honest, few countries could now defend themselves against aggression as intensively as we do. So many shells and weapons are simply non-existent. But there are still more potential aggressors in the world and frozen conflicts that can flare up again than such countries. Hence, there is an insane security deficit., Therefore, the more forms of terror Russia will use in this war, the more funds the world will eventually direct to weapons and to defense against a potential repetition of such attacks as we are experiencing., Another example... Instead of paying maximum attention to the green transformation, various governments are equally looking for ways to guarantee cheaper supplies of oil, gas, and coal in order to lower energy prices., It is the price of energy, not the purity of energy, that is the number 1 issue for many. And it wouldn't be like that if it weren't for Russian aggression - and Russia's use of energy resources as a weapon., The third example... In just a few weeks, the threat of starvation for tens of millions of people arose completely artificially. Not because of a drought or an economic crisis, but because of the military blockade of our ports - a food exporting country., The world has not seen anything like this for decades., Any new disaster in one or another country due to high food prices or, God forbid, due to famine, is minus years for global development., Many different topics were discussed at your Forum during these days... But how many of them do not depend on what Russian aggression has brought and, unfortunately, can still bring? Minority., Therefore, when Ukraine offers a peace formula, it is really a peace formula not just for us, but for the world., When the threat is complex, the response must be complex as well. Nothing can be solved by simply ceasing fire. This is our formula. We need to restore peace - reliably and for the long term. You will not restore stability by simply mitigating the crises provoked by Russia. Every threat must be completely dismantled., The other day, at the summit in Indonesia, I presented exactly such proposals of ours - reliable peace and complete dismantling of Russian threats. And I thank everyone who supports the Ukrainian peace formula., And now I want to add one more component., What does peace mean? It's very practical, actually. This is saving lives. Stabilization. Development., Development!, Already now, by joining the reconstruction of Ukraine, various countries and companies are receiving incentives for growth., But when we restore territorial integrity and guarantee reliable peace, Ukraine will become a powerful source of new global development., And it's not just about the economy. It’s about the modern economy., I will give you three more examples., Ukraine is able to replace dirty fossil fuels from Russia with clean energy., We have huge potential in low-carbon energy. Ukraine is capable of becoming a key partner of the European Union for the purposes of decarbonization., We will become one of the main suppliers of green hydrogen and green electricity in the EU., Climatic conditions of Ukraine, free space, solar energy, wind energy will allow the production of green electricity with a very competitive cost., Just three years before the Russian invasion, we built 7 gigawatts of renewable energy. The potential is many times more., Plus, Ukraine can produce tens of millions of tons of green and cheap ammonia. Plus, strong positions in bioenergy. Plus, powerful nuclear energy and energy infrastructure, which is integrated with the energy grid of the European Union., Now the Russian missile terror is targeted primarily at these our facilities. Only the day before yesterday, Russia fired almost a hundred missiles against our energy facilities in one day. Almost a hundred! Today again..., Of course, the losses are great. But this only means that the reconstruction will be large-scale., I invite your countries and companies to already assess the prospects and join our reconstruction., By the way, we now have the decision of one of the largest Australian private investment groups, which has committed to invest the first 500 million dollars specifically in the Green Growth Initiative of Ukraine as part of the creation of the $25 billion Recovery Fund., I am grateful to Mr. Andrew Forrest for the decision to be the first, and also to Mr. Larry Fink of BlackRock for helping to structure this Fund., Another example is resource extraction., The modern economy needs lithium, graphite and other rare earth metals. We have the largest reserves of some of these resources in Europe., These are already colossal opportunities., Plus production and transport capabilities, plus our potential in mechanical engineering, our work culture and access to the world's leading markets - this is the basis for exactly the economic growth that everyone so desperately needs., The third is the agricultural sector. The world saw that it is impossible to guarantee global food security without Ukrainian exports., Our export grain initiative already helps with stabilization. And a decision has just been made to extend it by 120 days. But Ukraine's proposal is to extend the Black Sea Initiative indefinitely. This is vital for stability., Plus, we founded the Grain From Ukraine program to provide together with our partners as much food aid to the poorest countries as possible., But the return of peace to Ukraine will mean that we will be able not only to stabilize the market in response to the crisis, but to guarantee food stability and the prevention of any crises., And again, I gave only three examples, and there are many more., Peace in Ukraine is a global need. I emphasize - not a temporary lull, not an illusion of peace, which Russia tempts with to simply prepare a new stage of aggression, but real peace. I know it can be achieved., But for this we need to preserve global unity - and continue to support our struggle for freedom. It is necessary to preserve global integrity - and increase pressure on Russia for terror. And it is necessary to preserve global rationality - and cooperate with us for the sake of future development already now., Once again, thank you for your attention!, And let there be reliable peace., Glory to Ukraine!"
16 November 2022  - 21:48 ,"We are returning everything to have normal life in Kherson region, Mykolaiv region – address of President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, Today was a long and hard day. And now, in the evening, it seems that the events of the morning happened at least yesterday or the day before yesterday..., The summit in Indonesia. I took part in today's work of the leaders., Then – another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, discussion in detail. The situation at the front. Also, the military presented all the available data on the missile hitting the territory of Poland. Everyone responsible for liquidating the consequences of Russian missile strikes on Ukraine reported on the recovery work., Recovery does not stop for a minute., Emergency blackouts and stabilization outages continue in 18 regions and the city of Kyiv. These are millions of consumers. We are doing everything to restore electricity – both generation and supply., Another meeting of the ""Ramstein"" defense group took place. The key issue is the strengthening of our anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense., I held negotiations with the vice president of the World Bank, who is responsible for our region. We discussed projects for the reconstruction of our infrastructure and social facilities, the work of the Recovery Fund of our country., The total cost of projects discussed today is billions of dollars. This is something that needs to be rebuilt now to guarantee a normal life for people., There were reports on the liberation of the territories of Kherson region – we are doing everything to provide people with electricity, water, communications, financial and social services, and normal medicine as soon as possible., Pharmacies are finally reopening in Kherson, the post office, banks are working. People are getting access to the Internet. There are already 30 humanitarian aid distribution points., Electricity was restored to more than 20 de-occupied settlements in Kherson region., Mykolaiv region is the same. We return everything necessary for a normal life., We are working to restore the water supply to Mykolaiv. Payment of pensions has started in Snihurivka., And I thank everyone who provides recovery. And especially our sappers and rescuers. Thanks to their work everyone else can work safely., Once again, I will repeat to everyone in the de-occupied territory: please be very careful!, Russia wants to kill even after fleeing from our land. Therefore, you need to be very careful., If you see anything suspicious, report it to the emergency services and the police. If a building has not yet been checked by sappers, please do not enter it. If a road has not been checked yet, please skip it., Reports and messages from Donetsk region are unchanged. Fierce battles continue at the same points as before. We hold our positions despite dozens of attacks., Of course, there was a lot of international communication. Not everything can be talked about now. We protect the interests of Ukraine, as always., Today is the professional day of thousands of our people who perform one of the most important jobs. And this is not only the work to inform people., The Day of Radio, Television and Communication Workers is about those who strengthen democracy at all times. Who integrates society informationally, emotionally and politically. Who unites our interests, our pain and our joys, our hopes and aspirations, our problems., The stronger this sphere is in the country, the stronger the democracy is there., I sincerely congratulate everyone who works in this field – each one., Those who make a telethon and those who work on other information platforms. Presenters, reporters whom we see and hear, studio workers, producers, editorial staff, whom society usually does not see and hear, but without whom this industry simply would not exist. Thank you all for your work for Ukrainians!, Today there was a rather long interview. I also held an ""off the record"" meeting for journalists – specifically for radio and television workers., And the day is not over yet..., There is also a meeting of the UN Security Council regarding the new wave of Russian missile terror. We are monitoring statements, working with partners, and defending Ukrainian interests., Of course, one of the main issues at the Security Council meeting is the situation in Poland, the clarification of all the circumstances of how Russian aggression crossed the Polish border., The Ukrainian position is very transparent: we strive to establish all the details, every fact., That is why we need our specialists to join the work of the international investigation and to get access to all the data available to our partners and the site of the explosion., All our information is in full access, we have been giving it to our partners since the night, from those first hours when the world began to find out what happened., I spoke with President Duda last night and expressed my condolences to him – Russian aggression took the lives of two Polish citizens., And I want all of us to honor the memory of all those whose lives were taken by this Russian war with a minute of silence., Citizens of Ukraine, citizens of Poland..."
16 November 2022  - 09:21 ,"Take the Ukrainian defense experience to guarantee the security of your people - speech by the President of Ukraine during the participation in the ""Digital Transformation"" panel within the G20 summit",", Thank you very much, Mr. President Widodo., Dear colleagues!, Yesterday at our summit, everyone talked about how to end the Russian war. The Russian representative even made some comments..., And after that, almost 100 Russian missiles hit Ukraine. Burnt residential buildings. Destroyed power plants again. Hundreds of cities were left without electricity, water and heat. Internet traffic has fallen by two-thirds – imagine the scale., Unfortunately, there are human casualties. And not only in Ukraine! Russian missiles hit the territory of neighboring Poland yesterday. There should be a quick response., This missile attack is Russia's real performance at G20. So when I say G19, I'm not wrong. Because Russia is a terrorist, and we protect ourselves from it. Such is the reality., And I urge you to look at today's panel of our Digital Transformation Summit from a security perspective. This will be a timely view., Dear leaders, you now clearly see what modern war is. Today, it is impossible to imagine life without computer networks, high-speed communication, the Internet, and even more so - without electricity. But your enemies may try to deprive you of just that., My good advice to you is to take Ukrainian defense experience in order to guarantee the safety of your people., We have created an IT army that prevails in cyberspace. The best specialists and companies of the country have united to protect the state., We repelled more than 1,300 cyberattacks during the 8 months of the Russian war. In the first week of the invasion, Russia destroyed a key data center of our country, and the response solution is the ""clouds"" into which we moved part of the information systems., We have built the protection of public registers. We have preserved the digital resilience of banks. Thanks to digitization, we can quickly organize social payments to those affected by hostilities., Millions of Ukrainians use our Diia state service every day. These are more than 100 public services without contact with officials. A digital passport, opening accounts, paying fines and taxes, receiving state aid, raising funds to support the army... All this is Ukrainian ""Diia""., If you or your allies and partners do not already have such a system and such digital protection, we will be happy to help you build them!, Cyber defense is about cooperation. The stability of institutions is cooperation. Reliable communication, including satellite communication, is also about cooperation., What we all need is to put aside disputes and develop collective efforts for global peace. The G19 can be very successful in this!, Ukraine is willing to help. Our security experience is your security experience., And please remember that everything must now be considered from the point of view of security., Thank you Mr. President Widodo for a very meaningful summit! Thank you all for your support!, Let there be peace!, Glory to Ukraine!"
15 November 2022  - 22:28 ,"Russia is told about peace, it responds with missiles - address by the President of Ukraine",", Fellow Ukrainians!, Today, the enemy launched another massive missile attack on our country., A total of 90 missiles. Energy system, enterprises, and residential buildings were damaged., And when did it happen?, As soon as the first day of the G20 summit ended in Indonesia, the most significant statements were made, the key meetings took place., Russia is told about peace, but it fires missiles in response. It is told about the global crises that Russia caused, and it launches Iranian drones in response., It is offered ten points to end the war, and it fires ten missiles per each point about peace., At half past three this morning I joined the summit to present our proposals for restoring international peace and order. The world heard Ukraine. G19 members made their statements..., And then in Moscow they decided that they could try again to achieve with terror what they could not and would not be able to achieve for the ninth month., 15:24 - rocket, Kyiv. And throughout the country... How we lived today..., 15:54 – rocket, Kropyvnytskyi. , 15:56 – two rockets, Kirovohrad region., 15:56 – rocket, Zhytomyr region. And also - Ivano-Frankivsk region, Rivne region, Kharkiv region..., 16:29 – rocket, Kryvyi Rih., 16:29 – rocket, Poltava region., 16:35 – Zhytomyr region again. Kyiv region, Lviv region, Odesa region, Mykolaiv region. And also - Volyn, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil region... And again Kyiv., Killed and wounded people. My condolences to the families!, In many cities and regions of our country, there are again emergency blackouts. About ten million Ukrainians are without electricity. Most of them - as of this moment - in Kharkiv region, Zhytomyr region, Kyiv region and Lviv region. Lviv and some other cities suspended the supply of heat... All over the country there are problems with communication and the Internet., As a result of the strikes, automation today disabled several nuclear units at two stations - these are calculated consequences, and the enemy knew exactly what he was doing., This is the answer of Russia to Indonesia, India, China and all other countries that talked about the need to end the war. Russia is telling the world that it wants to continue. Now it is time for the world to answer., Moreover, what we warned about a long time ago happened today. We’ve been telling this. Terror is not limited to our national borders. It has already spread to the territory of Moldova. And today, Russian missiles hit Poland, the territory of our friendly country. People died. Please accept condolences from all Ukrainian brothers!, How many times has Ukraine said that the terrorist state will not be limited to our country?, Poland, the Baltic states... It's only a matter of time before Russian terror goes further. We must put the terrorist in his place! The longer Russia feels impunity, the more threats there will be to everyone who can be reached by Russian missiles., Hitting NATO territory with missiles... This is a Russian missile attack on collective security! This is a really significant escalation. Action is needed., And I want to tell all our Polish brothers and sisters now... Ukraine will always support you! Terror will not break free people! Victory is possible when there is no fear! We don't have it, neither do you., I want to thank all partners who help protect the sky. In particular, our NASAMS systems worked well today: ten hits out of ten launches., As of this hour, more than 70 missiles and 10 combat drones have been shot down., I thank all our American and European friends who help us ensure such a result., I am also grateful to all our warriors of the ""South"", ""Center"", ""East"" and ""West"" air commands, as well as air defense units of the Ground Forces., I am grateful to all our rescuers, our energy workers who will work round the clock to restore normal life for Ukrainians. Restoration work has begun across the country., We will get through this too. We will restore everything., Russia opposes itself to the world. Russia loses on the battlefield. Russia terrorizes us and everyone it can reach. Let's do everything to stop it!, Glory to all who defend freedom!, Glory to all who work for our victory!, Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by terrorists!, Glory to Ukraine!"
15 November 2022  - 07:31 ,"Ukraine has always been a leader in peacemaking efforts; if Russia wants to end this war, let it prove it with actions - speech by the President of Ukraine at the G20 Summit",", Dear President Widodo!, Dear colleagues! The world’s majority, which stands with us!, I address you in Ukrainian, but in front of each of you on the table you will find our proposals. In your language. In demonstration of respect for you. , I have just returned to our capital. Returned from the city of Kherson., Kherson is one of the key cities in the south of our country and the only regional centre that Russia managed to occupy after February 24., And now Kherson is already liberated., What does it mean? For Ukraine, this liberation operation of our Defence Forces is reminiscent of many battles of the past, which became turning points in the wars of the past., Those battles symbolized such changes, after which people already knew who will be victorious even though the ultimate victory still had to be fought for., It is like, for example, D-Day - the landing of the Allies in Normandy. It was not yet a final point in the fight against evil, but it already determined the entire further course of events. This is exactly what we are feeling now., Now - when Kherson is free., To liberate our entire land from the Russists, we still will have to fight for a while longer... To fight! However, if the victory will be ours in any case, and we are sure of it, then shouldn't we try to implement our formula for peace to save thousands of lives and protect the world from further destabilizations?, That is why I want to present our vision of the path to peace - how to actually achieve it. And not only for us, but also for all of you, your allies and partners., In my statement in September of this year at UN General Assembly, I presented Ukraine’s formula for peace. A formula of peace for the world., Just when the world was hoping to recover from the blows of the pandemic, the Russian war provoked a whole series of new global challenges. This must be stopped!, There is a set of solutions that need to be implemented. And I want the conversation about it to be public, not behind the scenes. I want it to be discussed in specific terms, and not in broad strokes., Maybe I'll go over the allotted time limit., But the issue of peace is worth it., I want this aggressive Russian war to end justly and on the basis of the UN Charter and international law. Not ""somehow"" - according to the apt formulation of the UN Secretary-General António Guterres., Ukraine should not be offered to conclude compromises with its conscience, sovereignty, territory and independence. We respect the rules and we are people of our word., Ukraine has always been a leader in peacekeeping efforts, and the world has witnessed it. And if Russia says that it supposedly wants to end this war, let it prove it with actions., Apparently, one cannot trust Russia's words, and there will be no Minsks-3, which Russia would violate immediately after signing., If there are no concrete actions to restore peace, it means that Russia simply wants to deceive all of you again, deceive the world and freeze the war just when its defeats have become particularly notable., We will not allow Russia to wait it out, build up its forces, and then start a new series of terror and global destabilization., I am convinced now is the time when the Russian destructive war must and can be stopped., So, here are the proposals of Ukraine:, The first is radiation and nuclear safety., No one has the right to blackmail the world with a radioactive disaster. This is an axiom., However, in front of the eyes of the whole world, Russia has turned our Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant into a radioactive bomb that can explode at any moment. Where will the radiation cloud go? Perhaps towards the territory of the EU. Maybe to Türkiye. Maybe to the Middle East. I consider as criminal even a hypothetical possibility of such a scenario!, Radiation safety must be restored. The IAEA has already provided respective recommendations, confirming all the risks that we have repeatedly raised. Therefore, Russia must immediately withdraw all its militants from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP. The station must be immediately transferred to the control of the IAEA and the Ukrainian personnel. The normal connection of the station to the power grid must be restored immediately so that nothing threatens the stability of the reactors., We proposed that IAEA missions are sent to all Ukrainian nuclear plants - four of them, 15 nuclear units in total. Plus the Chornobyl plant, which has been shut down and is under conservation. Such missions can verify that any hostile activity against Ukrainian nuclear facilities has indeed ceased., How long does it take to implement it? Russia can begin the demilitarization of the Zaporizhzhia NPP as early as tomorrow if it is really ready to restore the radioactive safety it violated., The same goes for the crazy threats of nuclear weapons that Russian officials resort to. There are and cannot be any excuses for nuclear blackmail. And I thank you, dear G-19, for making this clear., However, please use all your power to make Russia abandon nuclear threats. The basis for such efforts can be the Budapest Memorandum and respective capabilities of the signatory states., The second challenge is food security., Thanks to the strong participation of the UN, Türkiye and other partners, we have demonstrated how the cooperation of a few can restore food security for the many., I believe our export grain initiative deserves an indefinite extension - no matter when the war ends., The right to food is a fundamental right of every person in the world., Since July, Ukraine has exported over 10 million tons of food by sea. We can increase exports by several million tons per month. Thus for this I propose to expand the grain export initiative to our other ports - in particular, to the ports of Mykolaiv and ""Olvia"" in the Mykolaiv region., I also call on all countries – and in particular your countries, dear G-19 leaders – to join our initiative to help the poorest with food., We have already launched the initiative – ""Grain From Ukraine"". And the first vessel - Nord Vind - leaves for Ethiopia with 27 thousand tons of wheat on board. This is the amount that can feed almost 100,000 people per year. There can be many such ships from Ukraine, and therefore there will be many people in poor countries who are saved from starvation., Ukraine can export 45 million tons of food this year. And let a significant part of it be directed to those who suffer the most., What do we propose exactly? Each country can join with a specific contribution and become a co-creator of the victory over hunger and the food crisis., The third is energy security., All of you can witness what the Russian terror is aimed at now. This is an attempt to turn the cold into a weapon. A weapon against millions of people., About 40% of our energy infrastructure were destroyed by the strikes of Russian missiles and Iranian drones used by the occupiers. Every week, Russia blows up our power plants, transformers, and electricity supply lines., A related goal of this terror is to prevent the export of our electricity to neighbouring countries, which could significantly help them stabilize the energy situation and reduce prices for consumers., Russia is interested in the energy crisis. And we should all be interested in ending terror., I thank all our partners who have already helped Ukraine with the supply of air defence and missile defence systems. This allows us to shoot down some of the Russian missiles and Iranian drones. But we must fully protect our sky. I ask you to increase respective assistance!, We have already proposed that a mission of UN experts is sent to the objects of critical energy infrastructure of Ukraine to assess the scope of damage and the needs for restoration, as well as to prevent their further destruction. We need to speed up the dispatch of this mission!, This will be a specific contribution of the international community to the stabilization of the energy situation in Ukraine and Europe, and therefore in the global energy market., However, regardless of the decisions of the world, any day Russia on its own can simply abandon strikes on Ukrainian energy generation and water and heat supply facilities. Let Russia prove by its rejection of terror that it is really interested in the restoration of peace., We must also take a fundamental step so that energy resources are no longer used as weapons. Price restrictions on Russian energy resources should be introduced., If Russia is trying to deprive Ukraine, Europe and all energy consumers in the world of predictability and price stability, the answer to this should be a forced limitation of export prices for Russia. So that the export price was not higher than the production cost. That's fair. If you take something away, the world has the right to take from you., The fourth challenge is the release of all prisoners and deportees., Thousands of our people - military and civilians - are in the Russian captivity. They are subjected to brutal torture - this is mass abuse!, In addition, we know by name 11 thousand children who were forcibly deported to Russia. They are separated from their parents in full knowledge that they have families. , Apart from the children, whose data we know, there are tens of thousands of those who were forcibly deported and about whom we know only indirectly. Among them are many, whose parents were killed by Russian strikes, and now they are being held in the state that murdered them., Add to that hundreds of thousands of deported adults, and you will see what a humanitarian catastrophe the Russian war has caused., Add political prisoners - Ukrainian citizens who are held in Russia and in the temporarily occupied territory, in particular in Crimea., We must release all these people!, I want to point out that we did not find support from the International Committee of the Red Cross. We do not see that they are fully fighting to gain access to the camps, where Ukrainian prisoners of war and political prisoners are held. Neither they are helping to find deported Ukrainians. This self-withdrawal is the self-destruction of the Red Cross as an organization that was once respected., We cannot wait., Therefore, we must unite for the sake of the only realistic model of the release of prisoners - ""all for all""., And also for the release of all children and adults who were deported to Russia., I thank the partners for their efforts, which allowed the release of many Ukrainians and foreign citizens, who were captured by the Russians. And let your leadership and the sincere heart of other leaders, who are present now, help free other Ukrainians as well., The fifth – implementation of the UN Charter and restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and the world order., Article 2 of the UN Charter defines everything very clearly. Everything that Russia violated by this war., Therefore, we must restore the validity of international law - and without any compromises with the aggressor. Because the UN Charter cannot be applied partially, selectively or ""at will""., Russia must reaffirm the territorial integrity of Ukraine within the framework of the relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly and the applicable international legally binding documents., It is not up to negotiations., The sixth challenge is withdrawal of Russian troops and cessation of hostilities., There is a clear understanding of how to achieve this., Russia must withdraw all its troops and armed formations from the territory of Ukraine. Ukraine's control over all sections of our state border with Russia must be restored., This will result in a real and complete cessation of hostilities., Every day of delay means new deaths of Ukrainians, new threats to the world, and an insane increase in losses due to continuation of the Russian aggression – losses for everyone in the world., The seventh – justice., This is what stokes the greatest emotions., Everywhere, when we liberate our land, we see one thing - Russia leaves behind torture chambers and mass burials of murdered people., This was the case in Bucha and other cities in the north of the country after the occupation. This was the case in the Kharkiv region. The same we observe now in the Kherson region., As of today, we have a full information about four hundred and thirty children killed by Russian strikes. Only children! And only those about whom we know everything for sure., And how many mass graves are there in the territory that still remains under the control of Russia? What will we see in Mariupol?, That is why the world should endorse establishment of the Special Tribunal regarding the crime of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and the creation of an international mechanism to compensate for all the damages caused by this war. Compensation at the expense of Russian assets, because it is the aggressor who must do everything to restore the justice violated by it., We have already proposed a resolution of the UN General Assembly regarding an international compensation mechanism for damages caused by the Russian war. It is endorsed. We ask you to implement it., We are also preparing the second resolution - on the Special Tribunal. Please join and support it., Because there is no such nation in the world that does not appreciate justice., The eighth challenge is ecocide, the need for immediate protection of environment., Millions of hectares of forest were burned by shelling. Almost two hundred thousand hectares of our land are contaminated with unexploded mines and shells. Dozens of coal mines are flooded, including the mine in which an underground nuclear test explosion was carried out in 1979..., This is the “Yunkom” mine in the Donetsk region. It is located on the territory occupied by Russia. It has been flooded for several years - precisely because of the occupiers. Everyone in Moscow knows what a threat it poses not only to the rivers in the Donetsk region, but also to the Black Sea basin. Only the de-occupation of our territory can provide the conditions for the elimination of this threat., It is impossible to accurately calculate the amount of atmospheric pollution from burnt oil depots and other fires... As well as from blown up sewage facilities, burned chemical plants, innumerable burial sites of slayed animals., Just imagine this – due to the Russian aggression, 6 million domestic animals died. 6 million! These are official numbers. At least 50,000 dolphins were killed in the Black Sea. Thousands of hectares of soil are contaminated with harmful substances - most of them are fertile soils. Were fertile soils., During the last week’s Climate Summit in Egypt, I proposed a platform to assess the environmental damage of war. We have to implement it., We must also find common responses to all environmental threats created by the war. Without this, there will be no return to a normal, stable life, and the reverberations of the war will remain for a long time - in the explosions of mines that will take the lives of children and adults, in the pollution of water, soil and atmosphere., I thank all the countries that are already helping us with demining. There is an urgent need for an increased number of equipment and experts for these operations., Funds and technologies are also needed for the restoration of water treatment facilities., This is not just a Ukrainian problem. This is a challenge for the whole world., The next - the ninth – is the prevention of escalation., A risk that still exists and will remain until our security is properly ensured., Ukraine is not a member of any of the alliances. And Russia was able to start this war precisely because Ukraine remained in the grey zone - between the Euro-Atlantic world and the Russian imperialism. Now we do not have any security assurances either. So, how can we prevent repetition of Russia’s such aggression against us?, We need effective security assurances. That is why we prepared a draft agreement – the Kyiv Security Compact, and have already presented it to partners., Thus, we should hold an international conference to cement the key elements of the post-war security architecture in the Euro-Atlantic space, including guarantees for Ukraine., The main outcome of the conference should be the signing of the Kyiv Security Compact., We can do it any time - even this year. And we must do it., And the tenth – confirmation of the end of the war., When all the antiwar measures are implemented, when security and justice begin to be restored, a document confirming the end of the war should be signed by the parties., I would like to emphasize that none of the steps above can take long. A month for one step at the most. For some steps, a couple of days are enough., We already have a positive experience with the grain export initiative. How does it work?, There is the UN - and two other parties to the agreements: on one side Ukraine, Türkiye and the UN, and on the other side Russia, Türkiye and the UN., Implementation of each of the points I have just presented can be worked out in a similar fashion. States ready to take the lead in this or that decision can become parties to the arrangement. , Once again:, radiation and nuclear safety; food security; energy security; release of all prisoners and deported persons; implementation of the UN Charter and restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and the world order; withdrawal of Russian troops and cessation of hostilities; restoration of justice; countering ecocide; preventing escalation; and finally - confirmation of the end of the war., Dear leaders!, I have outlined the paths each of you can choose for yourself - how to become a co-creator of peace., Please choose your path for leadership - and together we will surely implement the peace formula., What will it do?, It will save thousands of lives. It will restore the validity of international law. It will revitalize the security architecture. It will return the global stability, without which the whole world is suffering. In essence – this is what the honest countries of the world are cooperating for., Peace is a global value. That, which is important for every person in the world. , I am confident that it is likewise for each of you, leaders of G-19., I have outlined specific, practical solutions. They can be implemented. Quickly. They are effective., And if Russia opposes our peace formula, you will see that it only wants war., Ukraine is grateful to everyone in the world who helps us to protect freedom and to restore peace., Let our joint efforts be crowned with success as soon as possible and be reflected in the outcomes of this summit., Thank you for the invitation!, Glory to Ukraine!"
14 November 2022  - 23:55 ,The reparations that Russia will have to pay for what it has committed are now part of the international legal reality - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today was a very productive and symbolic day - a day in the Kherson region, in the Mykolaiv region., First of all, I had the honor of personally presenting our warriors with state awards. In Kherson, I presented 36 orders of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi and ""For Courage"", and handed over three more orders to wounded warriors., In particular, Brigadier General Oleksandr Tarnavskyi was awarded the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi of the 1st degree. In September, he became the commander of the Kherson operational-strategic group of troops, and we can see the result., The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to intelligence officer, sergeant Andriy Orlov. Back in September, he showed extraordinary bravery and effectiveness in battles in the Kherson region. He was wounded and recovered. Returned to the frontline. And already on November 10, as part of a reconnaissance unit, he took part in the liberation of Snihurivka. It was he who raised the Ukrainian flag over the district administration building., Of course, there will be more awards, there will be more gratitude. All our warriors who restore freedom to Ukrainians and the Ukrainian land deserve the utmost gratitude. It is so. It will be so., I held several meetings today - both in the Kherson region and in the Mykolaiv region. We will do everything to restore normal living conditions for our people., It is obvious to everyone what Ukraine is, what the presence of our flag is. When there is a Ukrainian flag, there is civilization, there is freedom. There is social security. There is infrastructure. There is security. There is someone to take care of people. There are all the things that disappear and that are destroyed when the occupier comes., This is what the Russian flag means - complete desolation. There is no electricity, no communication, no Internet, no television. The occupiers destroyed everything themselves - on purpose. This is their special operation. On the eve of winter, the Russian occupiers destroyed absolutely all critical infrastructure for the people. Absolutely all important objects in the city and region are mined., It is happiness for everyone when Russia is driven out. Happiness, which will also be in those cities and communities of ours, which are deprived of a normal life by Russia both after February 24 and in 2014. We will return everything. We will return normal life. And we know that peace for Ukraine is getting closer. For our entire country., In a few hours, I will talk about this in my address to the participants of the… G19 summit in Indonesia. This is an association of very influential states. And today, on the eve of the summit, influential statements have already been made., In particular, it is important that the United States and China jointly noted the inadmissibility of any threats to use nuclear weapons. Everyone understands whom these words are addressed to., Today, we also have decisions from our partners that strengthen Ukraine's position. I am grateful to Canada for the new package of defense support for our country in the amount of half a billion dollars. And also for new sanctions against Russian accomplices of tyranny - against the cogs of this system., I am grateful to the United States for the new sanctions. Today, sanctions have been introduced against more than 40 legal entities and individuals who help Russia wage a war. Absolutely everyone who in one way or another works for the Russian army, the defense sector, must receive complete personal isolation from the rest of the world. And then there will be punishment for complicity in terror., Within the UN, our diplomats worked for a long time with partners to agree on and adopt two very important resolutions. The first of them is supported today - regarding the creation of an international compensation mechanism that will make it possible to compensate all the losses caused by the Russian war, moreover at the expense of Russian assets. The reparations that Russia will have to pay for what it has committed are now part of the international legal reality., We are still agreeing with our partners on the second resolution - to create a special tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. We will do everything to make them both work., Today, a meeting of the Coordination Council of Ukraine for Child Protection and Safety co-chaired by UN Secretary-General António Guterres and Head of the Office Andriy Yermak was held. I thank Mr. Guterres for that., They discussed how to stop the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia and return home all those who were forcibly deported. At least these are almost 11 thousand children - we know them by name. But these are only the ones we know about. And in fact, there are more deported., The meeting was also attended by the ambassadors of the leading states, whom we call on to help with the implementation of this task. We will really need the power of the whole world to bring back all the deportees., I believe that we can ensure it!, I am grateful to everyone who helps Ukraine!, I am grateful to everyone who fights and works for our country!, Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine and our people., Glory to Ukraine!"
13 November 2022  - 21:24 ,All of us already feel the approach of our victory - address by the President,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, It is Sunday today. I’m in my office together with our team. The Office is working, Kyiv doesn’t stop, the country works non-stop. Look around - there are always people fighting and working without weekends for the sake of our victory. , The frontline has no weekends. Rescuers and sappers have no weekends. , Doctors helping the wounded have no weekends. Doctors helping our children have no weekends as well. , Ukrainian energy workers fighting against Iranian drones have no rest. , All our transport workers… truck drivers ensuring both the defense and the rear, Ukrzaliznytsia and all public companies. , Business, which helps. Volunteers we can’t do without. Military enterprises repairing and manufacturing equipment. , Diplomats working almost round the clock for 263 days already… Communication workers, security forces, hundreds and hundreds of other spheres, thousands of organizations and enterprises, millions of people. , All of us already feel the approach of our victory. Because we preserve our unity and know that we are rightfully on our land., And I thank our commanders, intelligence and everyone involved for working out our next steps. Liberation steps., Stabilization and restoration of law and order in 226 settlements will be ensured in the Kherson region. This is more than 100,000 local residents as of this time., We are restoring communication, Internet, television. We are doing everything to restore normal technical capabilities for electricity and water supply as soon as possible., We will bring back transport and postal services. We will bring back ambulances and normal medicine., Of course, the restoration of the work of authorities, the police, some private companies is already beginning. And I thank the business, which is among the first to participate in the return of normal life., Our presence will be felt! It will be felt that there is life., But please do not forget that the situation in the Kherson region is still very dangerous. First of all, there are mines. Unfortunately, one of our sappers died, and four others were injured while clearing mines., I urge all residents of Kherson to be very careful and immediately inform the rescuers about all dangerous objects., Detention of Russian soldiers and mercenaries who were left behind in this territory and neutralization of saboteurs are also ongoing., Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes, the bodies of both civilians and military personnel are being found., In the Kherson region, the Russian army left behind the same atrocities as in other regions of our country, where it was able to enter., We will find and bring to justice every murderer. Without a doubt., The fighting in the Donetsk region is as intense as in previous days. The level of Russian attacks is not decreasing. The level of resilience and bravery of our fighters is the highest. We do not allow our defense to be breached., I thank each of our warriors for this!, As of now, the territory of five of our regions was hit by missile, air and artillery strikes of the occupiers during the day. These are Sumy region, Kharkiv region, Zaporizhzhia region, Luhansk region, and Donetsk region., We do everything to make the enemy feel our retaliation. To the maximum., Along the entire frontline, we ensure the destruction of enemy supply chains, ammunition depots, and enemy headquarters., We have to reduce the potential of the occupiers every day - without days off! It saves the lives of our people., And we are already very actively preparing for an important week for Ukraine - diplomatic week., There will be a G20 summit in Indonesia and our position will be presented., In a very meaningful way. We will give answers to many questions that are being asked now. Public answers. So that they are heard by all our people, all our partners, everyone who supports us., Already on Tuesday there will be my address., I am grateful to everyone who endures this marathon!, I am grateful to everyone who fights and works for our country and freedom for all our people!, I am grateful to everyone who helps!, Glory to Ukraine!"
12 November 2022  - 20:05 ,Defense forces win back control in more than 60 settlements of Kherson region – address of President of Ukraine,", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, Today we all feel enthusiastic together. I don't know if we have at least one person who hasn't watched the video of our Kherson people greeting the Ukrainian defenders., Months of Russian occupation, months of the mockery of our people, months of stories that Russia is supposedly there forever... And still, there is a sea of Ukrainian flags on the streets. People did not even think of refusing Ukraine. And the world sees it now. It sees what it means when Ukrainians meet their own people. It sees what the unity of Ukrainians means. And it sees why we should liberate our entire land from the invaders., We will see many more such greetings. In those cities and villages that are still under occupation. We don't forget anyone, we won't leave anyone. Thanks to our defense operations and diplomacy, we will definitely reach our state border – all sections of the internationally recognized border of Ukraine., As of this evening, the defense forces have won back control in more than 60 settlements of Kherson region, the police have started taking stabilization measures. Stabilization measures are also ongoing in Kherson itself., Everywhere in the liberated territory, our bomb-disposal experts have a lot of work to do. Almost 2,000 explosive items have already been removed – mines, trip wires, and unexploded ammunition., Before fleeing from Kherson, the occupiers destroyed all critical infrastructure – communication, water supply, heat, electricity... Ruscists everywhere have the same goal – mockery of people as much as possible. But we will restore everything. Believe me. Although it takes time for this, it is already clear to everyone that the outcome will be ours, the Ukrainian one., It is very important now to tell all Kherson residents to be careful and not try to independently check any buildings and objects left by the occupiers. Please, if you have a connection with the townspeople, be sure to pass this on to them., There are ten groups of bomb-disposal experts working in Kherson, the police are working, and there are various units of the defense forces. Today, unfortunately, one of our sappers was injured during demining of the administrative building. Therefore, please, dear citizens of Kherson, be careful and inform the police or rescuers about any suspicious objects you see., The same concerns residents of other settlements in the liberated territory. Please remain vigilant of your own safety. It is very important., Separately, today I want to address all our military personnel who are in other areas of the front, to all those who take care of our security at the borders, to all those who defend Ukraine in the air and at sea, to all those who work for defense in the rear regions., This success of ours in the south became possible thanks to the fact that all our defenders honorably perform their tasks. The words of thanks that our defenders in Kherson region are hearing now are words of thanks to all of you. To everyone who fights for Ukraine, who works for our victory and who, at their level, helps and achieves the results our state needs., And especially these are words of thanks to those who endure the Russian attacks on Donetsk region – it's just hell there. There are extremely brutal battles there every day. But our units defend themselves bravely, withstand the terrible pressure of the occupiers, and maintain our defense lines. It is very important. Thanks to the strong defense there, in Donetsk region, we can conduct offensive operations in other directions. I thank all our soldiers who defend Ukraine in these particularly tough battles. Pavlivka, Maryinka, Pervomaiske, Avdiyivka..., The first and second battalions of the 36th Separate Brigade of Marines, the 79th Separate Assault Brigade, the 72nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, the 68th Separate Hunter Brigade, the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade, the 56th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade and the 55th Zaporizka Sich Separate Artillery Brigade, which supports everyone there... Thank you, soldiers, for your courage, for your bravery!, And I join the thanks and wishes that have already been heard from the people of Kherson by our fighters of the 28th and 63rd Separate Mechanized Brigades and the 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade, our intelligence officers, our fighters of the Special Operations Forces and national guardsmen. Well done. Thank you all for the brilliant performance of tasks for the liberation of Kherson!, It will be the same in Henichesk and Melitopol. We will also come to all our cities and villages of Donbas. We will definitely see how people with Ukrainian flags, which they keep there, will meet the Ukrainian forces in Crimea, and there will be hundreds of them on the streets on the day of liberation., I thank everyone who fights and works for Ukrainian victory! I'm thankful to everyone in the world who helps us so much!, Eternal glory to all those who gave their lives for their native Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!,

11 November 2022  - 19:49 ,"Today is a historic day, we are regaining Kherson - address by the President of Ukraine",", Ukrainians!, Strong people of our indomitable, beautiful and united country!, Today is a historic day. We are regaining the south of our country, regaining Kherson. As of now, our defenders are approaching the city, there is still quite a bit left and we are starting to enter. However, special units are already in the city., The people of Kherson were waiting. They never gave up on Ukraine. Hope for Ukraine is always justified - and Ukraine always regains its own., I am happy to see how people, despite all the threats, despite the repression and abuse of the occupiers, cherished the Ukrainian flags, believed in Ukraine..., And even when the city is not yet completely cleansed of the enemy's presence, the people of Kherson themselves are already removing Russian symbols and any traces of the occupiers' stay in Kherson from the streets and buildings., It was the same in all other cities liberated by our defenders. It will be the same in those cities that are still waiting for our return. Ukraine will come to all its people. Due to our strength on the battlefield and in diplomacy, we will restore the territorial integrity of our state., I thank every warrior and every unit of the defense forces who are making this offensive operation in the south possible now. Absolutely everyone - from privates to generals. The Armed Forces, intelligence, Security Service, National Guard - all who were bringing this day closer for the Kherson region. We will name all the heroes soon. And they will be awarded even sooner., Shortly after our defense forces reach the designated frontiers, stabilization measures will begin in Kherson, as was the case everywhere. We consistently neutralize the threats., The first is mines. The occupiers left a lot of mines and explosives, in particular on vital objects. We will carry out demining., It is very important: now, when demining has not even begun, we cannot ensure access of media representatives to Kherson. It is necessary to demine at least basic communications, check the main objects., We will restore all conditions of normal life - as much as possible., Our defenders are immediately followed by policemen, sappers, rescuers, energy workers... Medicine, communications, social services are returning... Life is returning., I would like to separately address those Russian soldiers, mercenaries and collaborators who were left behind in Kherson and other cities of the south. The only chance for salvation for you is to surrender to Ukrainian captivity. We guarantee that you will be treated in accordance with the law and international standards. And to those Russian soldiers who have put on civilian clothes and are hiding somewhere I want to say that there is no point in hiding. We'll find you anyway. Don't drag it out. Voluntary Ukrainian captivity is the only option for all occupiers., I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. First and foremost is the situation on the frontline, of course, with an emphasis on the developments in the south. But we do not reduce our attention to other areas. We are moving everywhere, reinforcing our positions everywhere. We are holding the line in the Donetsk region., Separately, the situation in the energy sector and the course of restoration work were reviewed. Last night, the occupiers dealt another blow to our critical infrastructure. It is because of this that emergency blackouts had to be applied in parts of the country this morning and afternoon. But in most cities and districts we managed to return to the schedule of stabilization energy restrictions., And we are working as actively as possible to strengthen our ability to protect the sky and restore everything that the occupiers, unfortunately, destroyed., I spoke today with Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz. Informed him about the situation in Kherson, generally at the front. I thanked him for the next steps in defense support, we agreed on the development of such cooperation., Of course, preparations for the G20 summit were discussed. It is obvious that Russia does not think about peace. Another terrorist attack on Mykolaiv, the destruction of a residential building by a Russian rocket is a clear proof of what really worries Russia: not how to reach peace, but how to inflict the most painful damage... Not how to start real negotiations, but how to hit something with a missile or drone in Ukraine so that Ukrainians suffer..., Well, Ukraine and the world have the power to punish the terrorists for everything they have done and restore peace. Peace on our terms., Our fundraising platform, United24, has launched a fundraising campaign for a fleet of naval drones. I announced that. So, now everyone - and not only in Ukraine, but also in other countries - can join the formation of the world's first naval drone fleet - something that can provide security to our marine area., The first naval drone, for which funds were raised in less than an hour, was named ""Kherson"". Quite logical. We will call the second naval drone ""Sevastopol"". I believe that all this is bringing the time of the liberation of our Crimea closer., I had a meeting with the Lithuanian delegation led by the Speaker of the Seimas of Lithuania. It is symbolic that her name is Viktorija. And it is on such a day that she is with us. I thanked our Lithuanian friends for their help, for the defense support that we have been receiving since the beginning of the Russian invasion. We discussed a wide range of topics: further cooperation in defense, our reconstruction, European and Euro-Atlantic integration of Ukraine., And one more thing., Today, another 45 Ukrainian defenders were released from Russian captivity, all of them are warriors of the Armed Forces, soldiers and sergeants., We remember all our heroes who are still in captivity. We will return each and every one. Our team - Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Maliuk, Lubinets and others - works every day to free all our people from Russian captivity., I sincerely thank everyone who cares about Ukraine!, Glory to everyone who fights for freedom!, Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by the occupiers., Glory to Ukraine!"
11 November 2022  - 15:17 ,Volodymyr Zelenskyy's greetings to US Veterans,", US Veterans!, On behalf of all Ukrainians, Happy Veterans Day and thank you for your service! , For almost 250 years the men and women of the United States armed forces have prevailed against tyranny often against great odds., Your example inspires Ukrainians today to fight back against Russian tyranny., Special thanks to the many American veterans who have volunteered to fight in Ukraine and – to the American people for the amazing support you have given Ukraine., With your help, we have stunned the world and are pushing Russian forces back., Victory will be ours., God Bless America and, Слава Україні!,  "
10 November 2022  - 22:09 ,Dozens of Ukrainian flags have already returned to their rightful place in the framework of the defense operation - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today we have good news from the south., The number of Ukrainian flags returning to their rightful place in the framework of the ongoing defense operation is already dozens. 41 settlements were liberated., I thank all our heroes who make this advance possible. Armed Forces, intelligence, special services... Everyone., And I will especially mention the warriors of the 28th separate mechanized brigade, the 46th airborne assault brigade, the 60th separate infantry brigade and the 128th separate mountain assault brigade. Those who implement offensive actions. Thank you guys!, Now we are all happy to see how the Ukrainians who remained in the occupied villages and cities meet our warriors., Many are now checking almost every hour where our units have reached and where else our national flag was raised., But, rejoicing, we should all remember now and always what this movement means, we should remember that every step of our defense forces is the lives of our warriors. Lives given for freedom for Ukrainians. Everything that is happening now has been achieved by months of fierce struggle. It was achieved through courage, pain, and loss. It's not the enemy leaving. It is the Ukrainians who drive the occupiers out at a heavy cost. Just as in the east of our country, in the Kharkiv region. Just as before, in the north - Kyiv region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region. Now - Mykolaiv region, Kherson region., We have to go all the way - on the battlefield and in diplomacy - for our flags, Ukrainian flags, and never again enemy tricolors, to be hoisted on our entire land, along our entire internationally recognized border. It will be so., Our warriors are virtually immediately followed to the liberated areas by those who restore all conditions for normal life., The first and basic one is demining. The occupiers leave behind thousands of unexploded mines and munitions. I have often heard estimates that clearing Ukraine of Russian mines will take decades. We can't wait that long., We have to do in years what elsewhere in the world could have taken decades after hostilities., First of all, houses, social facilities, communications, roads - the entire space of people's lives - are being demined., But the occupiers mine everything: power lines, enterprise buildings, fields, forests., At the peak of mine contamination in Ukraine, we had 300,000 square kilometers of dangerous territory., Today, thanks to the true heroism of Ukrainian sappers and pyrotechnicians, our rescuers and everyone who helps them, the area of land contaminated by mines and munitions has been reduced., Now about 170,000 square kilometers remain for demining. In particular, this is also the case in the most difficult areas - where hostilities are still ongoing, where the enemy will add mines before his retreat, as it is now in Kherson... Plus forests, plus a huge area of fields., I am grateful to our partners who are already implementing mine clearance assistance projects. These are the US, Canada and Great Britain, as well as Denmark, Norway, Estonia, Austria, Poland, Japan, Switzerland, Sweden, Slovakia, UN structures., Any person on earth - everyone who supports Ukraine - can make a personal contribution through our United24 charity platform., In particular, thanks to such aid, we have already purchased the first most effective demining machine - Armtrac 400 which is currently operating in the Kharkiv region., It covers 1.5 hectares in an hour, fully guaranteeing the disposal of mines. And first of all, it clears the territory along the power lines so that energy workers can fulfill their duties and restore power supply., We will add more such equipment and speed up demining wherever we return our flag, our normal Ukrainian life., The forces of the National Police immediately follow the warriors to the liberated areas., Today, the police entered Kalynivske, Bobrovyi Kut, Yevhenivka, Kotsyubynske and Snihurivka. Stabilization measures began there., I had two important phone calls today., Together with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom we discussed further defense support for our country and exchanged views of the ongoing frontline operations., We are preparing for important international events next week, in particular for the G20 summit, we are coordinating positions with partners., Together with the Prime Minister of Canada we also discussed the G20, our initiatives within the UN - we have important draft resolutions that we propose the General Assembly to support., Separately, we touched upon the areas of defense and security cooperation that already exist with Canada. We are planning to expand our cooperation., There are still important negotiations scheduled for tomorrow., Today I also want to thank the Netherlands for another step to strengthen our defense. 100 million euros will go to the fund to support our defense., These funds, as well as funds from other partners, will be used to purchase equipment directly from manufacturers and will work for the future. For Ukraine to become stronger., And one more thing., Today we have the announcement of a new military assistance package from the United States of America. Important means of air defense. Just what we needed, what we asked for., Glory to all who fight and work for our country and our people!, Gratitude to everyone who helps!, Eternal glory to all those who give their lives for Ukraine and who gave their lives., Glory to Ukraine!"
9 November 2022  - 22:44 ,"The enemy does not bring us gifts, ""gestures of goodwill,"" we fight our way up – address of President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, Today, the day started very early with a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The situation at the front line was analyzed in detail. South, east... Very carefully – Donbas., The greatest confrontation is now in Donetsk region, it's very important, a lot is being decided there. Any losses there are further losses in the country. That's why we stand. We stand firm. We don't surrender anything., I thank each of our heroes who are holding back these terrible attacks of the occupiers. Constant attacks., South. We are moving gradually, strengthening our positions step by step., There is a lot of joy in the media space today, and it is clear why. But our emotions must be restrained – always during war., I will definitely not feed the enemy with all the details of our operations, either in the south, or in the east, or anywhere else. When we have our result, everyone will see it. For sure., Maybe it doesn't sound like what anyone expects now. Maybe not as in the news. But you need to understand: no one just gets away if they don't feel the strength. The enemy does not bring us gifts, does not make ""gestures of goodwill."" We fight our way up. And when you are fighting, you must understand that every step is always resistance from the enemy, it is always the loss of the lives of our heroes., Therefore, we move very carefully, without emotions, without unnecessary risk. In the interests of the liberation of our entire land and so that the losses are as small as possible. This is how we will secure the liberation of Kherson, Kakhovka, Donetsk, and other our cities., But this will be the result of our efforts, our defense operations, those that are currently ongoing, those that we are planning., And now I want separately and once again to warn everyone in Moscow who makes the relevant decisions: any attempt by you to blow up the Kakhovka HPP and flood our territory and dehydrate the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant will mean that you are declaring war on the whole world. Think what will happen to you then., At the meeting of the Staff we also discussed the supply and production of weapons – our weapons – the repair of equipment, the strengthening of our anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense, which is ongoing, the recovery of critical infrastructure, primarily energy, after the Russian terrorist attacks., As of this evening, there are electricity blackouts to stabilize the situation in 15 regions and the city of Kyiv. There are no emergency blackouts., Wherever electricity is out, it should be in accordance with published schedules. Please, if the blackout at your house or street is not on schedule today, notify the local authorities and representatives of the energy company that serves you. They must change the situation and stick to the schedule., I spoke today with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte. Just about recovering our energy sector, protection of the Ukrainian sky. Thank you for your willingness to help!, Separately, we discussed the export grain initiative, the fundamental need to extend and expand our grain exports. We agreed to cooperate even more closely to support Ukrainian initiatives at the UN., Tomorrow will be a very active negotiation day – many contacts are planned., It is these days that we are completing our preparations for Ukraine's possible participation in the G20 summit next week. The Ukrainian stance has been shaped. As always, our stance will be in the interests of global security., In the evening, I signed another decree on awarding our soldiers. 106 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were given state awards., And one more thing is very important., Today is the Day of Ukrainian Writing and Language and the Ukrainian Day of Cultural Workers and Masters of Folk Art. There was also a dictation of national unity. I thank everyone who joined writing the dictation, it is an important annual tradition., And you know... Today I want to congratulate not only those who teach languages and literature, work in the field of culture and preserve folk art. I want to congratulate all our people. Ukraine holds. Ukraine defends itself. And will definitely defend., It is no longer a question of whether Ukraine and everything Ukrainian exist. Ukraine exists. Ukraine will exist., And our enemy will die – they will die like the dew does in the sunshine. Or like the Russian river crossings under the strikes of the HIMARS systems., Glory to Ukraine!"
8 November 2022  - 23:03 ,We are doing everything to ensure that the Russian plan to turn winter into a weapon fails - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, An important preparatory week for us continues on the eve of diplomatic activities in the second half of November. These are important summits: G20, ASEAN, NATO Parliamentary Assembly and some others. The position of Ukraine must be and will be heard in all parts of the world., We are also working to continue and expand our grain export initiative. We will add a permanent humanitarian component to grain exports. Together with the advanced and most conscientious states, we will increase aid to those countries and peoples who are particularly suffering from the food crisis., And the first meetings have already taken place, we already have the first international agreements. In fact, together with our partners, we are starting cooperation, which can become the basis for guaranteeing food security at a new level. It has long been said that global coordination is needed to save the world's poorest countries from starvation. And we are currently developing such a coordination mechanism. I hope it will be implemented., Today I met with United States Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield, and a significant part of our talks was devoted to humanitarian topics. Because the more meaningful our cooperation with partners to overcome various humanitarian problems will be, the less international conflicts and crises will be used by Russia to blackmail the international community., We separately discussed with Mrs. Thomas-Greenfield our steps within the UN General Assembly and draft resolutions proposed by Ukraine., It is very important that we talked about how to ensure the access of representatives of the UN and the Red Cross to Ukrainian men and women held in Russian captivity. We use every day and every international opportunity to move closer to the release of all our people from captivity. We remember everyone who is being held captive by the occupiers., In the information space, there is a certain decrease in the number of news from the front. There are fewer messages than, for example, at the beginning of autumn. But this does not mean that the intensity of the fighting has become less., The situation is difficult on the entire front. In some areas, brutal positional battles continue, as before, and it is especially difficult - also as before - in the Donetsk region. The activity of the occupiers there remains at an extremely high level - dozens of attacks every day. They suffer extremely large-scale losses, but their order has not changed - to reach the administrative border of the Donetsk region. We do not give up a single centimeter of our land there. And I thank all our heroes who are holding positions in Donbas., Kherson region. We clearly understand what the enemy is planning, so we act accordingly. Carefully, thoughtfully and in the interests of the liberation of our entire territory. We are reinforcing our positions, ruining Russian logistics, and consistently destroying the potential of the occupiers to keep the south of our country under occupation., East. Step by step, we are moving towards the return of the Ukrainian flag to all our cities and communities. We are also actively reinforcing the border., At the same time, work continues to restore normal life in the liberated areas. Only in the past day and only, for example, in two districts of the Kharkiv region, gas and electricity have been restored to more than a thousand households., Repair work is also ongoing at all the energy facilities damaged by the recent Russian strikes. As of this evening, about 4 million Ukrainians in 14 regions and the city of Kyiv are disconnected from electricity supply. But most of them are disconnected based on stabilization schedules, not on an emergency basis., I thank all our energy workers, utility workers, regional administrations, local self-governments - everyone who restores the predictability of life to our people even in such conditions., Today, the government of Ukraine made an important decision that will help get through the winter period. The import of goods needed during the heating season will be exempt from VAT and import duty. This should simplify and reduce the cost of supplying Ukraine with generators, batteries, transformers and other equipment for energy and heat supply., It is also important that sufficient volumes of gas and coal are being accumulated to provide for Ukrainians., We clearly understand: turning winter into a weapon is the plan of a terrorist state against our state, as well as against the whole of Europe. But we are doing everything so that this Russian plan also fails, like various previous ones., And one more thing., On the Walk of the Brave in Kyiv, we opened a plaque that appeared there first. This is a plaque dedicated to Sean Penn. He was in Ukraine on February 24 and since that day he has been doing everything to help us accumulate international support., The Walk of the Brave is not just a sign of our gratitude to political, public and cultural leaders who defend freedom together with Ukrainians, but also a reminder to all future generations of our people about what different people, forces and industries united for our victory., The Walk of the Brave will feature all the leaders who supported Ukraine personally, coming to our land at the crucial time of a full-scale war. When such a leader arrives in Ukraine now, we open his name plaque., In general, dozens of names will be presented on the Walk of the Brave. To date, in addition to Sean Penn, the following have already been honored: President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, President of Poland Andrzej Duda, President of Latvia Egils Levits, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Petr Fiala, Prime Minister of Slovenia Janez Janša, Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki, Deputy Prime Minister of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński., I thank everyone who helps Ukraine!, Glory to everyone who fights for our state!, Glory to our strong people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
8 November 2022  - 19:44 ,There can be no effective climate policy without peace on earth - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the 27th UN Conference on Climate Change in Sharm el-Sheikh,", Dear colleagues! , Dear Mr. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi! , Ladies and Gentlemen!, At this Conference, like at other summits and high level meetings on catastrophic climate change, there is no lack of words. There is no lack of good definitions and no shortage of prescriptions for what the world should do. I listened to some of the speeches today – and I agree with many of the assessments., The world is on the brink. And beyond this limit – devastating changes that will forever change the usual life on all continents. Colleagues have described well what this means. No one can stay aside., And the poorer the person, the poorer the family, the poorer the country – the more painful the effects of climate change will be for them. However, this also applies to all rich nations – it is impossible to buy off the destruction of the climate., But why do we keep talking about it every year? Why instead of reports on what has been done, the same forecasts and appeals are made every year?, I will be honest – there are still many who do not take the climate agenda seriously. And not only in politics, but also in big business., There are still many for whom climate change is just rhetoric or marketing or political ritual – whatever, but not real action., They are the ones who hamper the implementation of climate goals. They are the ones in their offices who make fun of those who fight to save life on the planet, although in public they seem to support the work for the sake of nature in every possible way. They are the ones who start wars of aggression when the planet cannot afford a single gunshot, because it needs global joint actions., You all know about the war that Russia started in Europe, trying to destroy the independence of my country. But what does this war mean?, This Russian war has brought about an energy crisis that has forced dozens of countries to resume coal-fired power generation in order to lower energy prices for their people at least a little... To lower prices that are shockingly rising due to deliberate Russian actions., The Russian war brought an acute food crisis to the world, which hit worst those countries suffering from the existing manifestations of climate change – catastrophic droughts, large-scale floods., The Russian war destroyed 5 million acres of forests in Ukraine in less than six months! Not every country in the world has such an area of forests that were burned in Ukraine by Russian shelling., We have to check every day the situation at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. If there is no radiation leaks? The Russian army has turned this nuclear power plant de-facto into a military training ground. They are constantly ""playing"" with connecting and disconnecting the plant and nuclear reactors from the power grid. This is a direct risk of a radiation disaster., Who will care, for example, about the amount of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere if part of Europe or the Middle East, and possibly northern Africa, God forbid, are covered by a radiation cloud after an accident in Zaporizhzhia? Last year we could not even imagine that kind of question, but this year Russia has posed dozens of such questions to the world., Ladies and Gentlemen! , World needs honesty.We must tell those who do not take the climate agenda seriously that they are making a catastrophic mistake., We must stop those who, with their insane and illegal war, are destroying the world's ability to work united for a common goal., There can be no effective climate policy without peace on the Earth. Because, in fact, nations are thinking only about how to protect themselves here and now from the threats created in particular by the Russian aggression., Russia needs to shut the guns and hide its missiles so the world finally hears what we can all really do together to save ourselves from the climate disaster. All of us – in Europe, Africa, Asia, America, Australia., I invite you all to support our initiative presented here at the Conference – creation of a global platform to assess the Impact of military actions on climate and environment., We are all thinking about how to generate hundreds of billions of dollars to help developing countries protect themselves from the climate change. Under these conditions, how can anyone cause additional insane damage to the nature with their invasive military ambitions? Such ambitions deserve only punishment., Mr. President of Egypt said an important thing in his speech: we must meet expectations of the people all over the world – people who are suffering more than ever. I absolutely support this goal., We must ensure that suffering does not multiply because the world does not have time to respond to climate challenges. But to do this, we need joint effective actions. And for them to be, we need peace., And I thank everyone who works for peace! I thank everyone who takes seriously the need to protect life on the Earth for the benefit of all people – all nations, all classes, all cultures., I thank you for your attention., Слава Україні!"
8 November 2022  - 12:45 ,"The Liberty Medal is for everyone who fights and works to protect Ukraine, everyone who supports us - speech by President  at the 34th award ceremony of the National Constitution Center",", Dear Friends!, It is a great honor to be awarded with the Medal of Liberty, presented to me by senators Chris Coons and Rob Portman during their visit to Kyiv., This award really demonstrates how and what Ukrainian people are fighting for. Liberty is the main word for us and what really unites all Ukrainians., As in any democratic society, Ukrainians have different views on life and politics. As the case was in previous years, we felt divided arguing whether we would ever be able to stand together., But when Russia decided to destroy our freedom and wipe Ukraine off the face of the earth, we immediately got united and we keep this unity., All divisions are put aside. There is no place for political conflicts. Because when there is a mortal threat to freedom, everything else is not important., Millions of people are fighting and working to protect Ukraine. They are very different people. After the Russian full-scale invasion started, they all decided – ""we are here"" and we will never give up our freedom., And I believe that this Liberty Medal is for all men and women of Ukraine who, after the 24th of February, showed to the world's largest autocracy that only defeat is what it can win in Ukraine. , These are our soldiers and officers. This is a massive wave of our volunteers – those who provide our defenders with everything they need. These are farmers who stopped Russian armored vehicles on the roads to their communities and helped the Army. These are IT specialists, who build defense against Russian cyberattacks. These are companies that work despite constant Russian terror and keep jobs for Ukrainians. These are doctors who help always everywhere. These are school teachers and university professors who can read lectures even in bomb shelters and distantly from the trenches on the front lines, but they do not give up and teach children – teach them to believe in themselves, in freedom and in Ukraine., In less than nine months, more than thirty thousand Ukrainians have been honored state awards for their contribution to our national defense., First of all, they are our heroic soldiers. These are rescuers who do away with the effects of Russian shelling. These are energy workers who return electricity to people after Russian missiles and Iranian drones hit power plants – Russia wants to leave millions of our people without energy in the winter. These are transport workers who supply our defense, economy and communities. These are different people of various jobs who are all equally fight against the invasion., However, this Liberty Medal is an award not only for our people., When this war began, Ukraine heard something very important from the world – we heard that ""the democracies are here."" And we see now what democracies are capable of when they act in unity., Every potential aggressor in the world sees the help that the United States and the free world is providing to us, and all the sanctions imposed against Russia – sees and believes that it is better not to start a war against freedom at all. In fact, this is one of the greatest contributions to the global peace and security during our lifetime., Together with our partners, we are developing a new security architecture – these are security guarantees for Ukraine and Europe which will not only re-empower the principles of the UN Charter, but will also become a model for nations in other parts of the world – a model to avoid new cruel wars., And that is why, I believe that this Liberty Medal is also to all friends of freedom in the United States and other countries. To all those, who are helping us to restore our territorial integrity, and thus to restore peace., This Liberty Medal is to those who support us with weapons, air defense systems, fInance and diplomacy. To those who are helping to rebuild after the Russian strikes. To those who impose sanctions against Russia and its accomplices such as the Iranian regime., When after the beginning of the Russian invasion, I said – ""the president is here"", when millions of Ukrainians decided at the same time – ""we are here"" and we will not surrender, and when the world supported us, saying – ""democracies are here"", then it meant and still mean – ""freedom is here "", ""human dignity is here"", ""law is here"". And one day it will definitely mean – ""peace is here""., I call on you to maintain unwavering unity, as it is now, until that very day when we all hear those important words we have been dreaming of… Until we hear that peace has finally been restored. Democracies must not stop on their way to the victory., I thank you for your attention! , Thank you for your support – President Biden, both parties of the Congress, and every American citizen! Please know that you support not just a country or its leader, you support millions of people who, like you, cherish freedom., And I decided to send the prize money of our Liberty Medal to help Ukrainian veterans – to rebuild and modernize the rehabilitation center for veterans in the city of Borodyanka, Kyiv region of Ukraine. Let everything bring our victory closer!, Слава Україні!"
7 November 2022  - 22:25 ,Escalation of Russian missile and drone terror only led to the world responding with new aid to Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, I’ve just spoken with Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the bloc that won the elections in Israel. I congratulated him on victory. We discussed the main aspects of relations between our states., I think it is clear to everyone what Ukraine emphasizes and what security emphasis Israel makes. I believe that we can significantly strengthen our states, especially since the threats to us are related., Today, the occupiers struck more than 50 settlements in our country. Donbas, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region, Mykolaiv region, Kharkiv region, Dnipropetrovsk region... Missiles, aviation, MLRS., We respond everywhere. We have the necessary results - another Russian aircraft was shot down., We also received new systems that significantly strengthen our air defense. The protection of the Ukrainian sky is, of course, not one hundred percent, but we are gradually moving towards our goal., As of today, we can say that the recent escalation of Russian missile and drone terror has only resulted in the world responding - responding with new aid to Ukraine. We will do everything so that as many countries as possible join this aid., In general, along the front, our forces are in a state of active defense - in some parts of the east and south, we are gradually pushing back the enemy. We are gradually moving forward., The Donetsk region remains the epicenter of the greatest madness of the occupiers - they die by the hundreds every day. The ground in front of the Ukrainian positions is literally littered with the bodies of the occupiers..., And some of the Russian military started to think about what was happening. They ""complained"" to the governor of their region - Primorsky Krai - about colossal losses. And this governor, comrade Kozhemyako, predictably lied in response: he says that the losses are ""far from being such""., Not such... And what kind are they?, From Vladivostok to Pavlovka, Donetsk region, it is more than 9 thousand kilometers. But he is sure that the losses ""are not such."" The governor, probably, can better see from there how many soldiers from his region are sent for slaughter and in what way. Or he was simply ordered to lie. Ordered from Moscow., This is how the order to lie about Russian losses crosses thousands of kilometers. And even the bodies of most of those killed will not be brought back to some Vladivostok. But I am sure that Governor Kozhemyako will come out and explain why not everyone arrived, not everyone from those “not such” returned., You can avoid this not by complaining to some wimps, but by your own opinion. And not in Telegram, but in public. Not by a complaint, but by a fierce protest. Not somewhere under the blanket, but on the streets. Against those in Moscow., Or by surrendering to Ukrainian captivity. This is how you can survive as well., Decision regarding some Ukrainian enterprises was announced today. This decision was dictated by military necessity and was agreed upon at the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. Five strategic enterprises were forcibly alienated for wartime needs - Motor Sich, KrAZ, Ukrnafta, Ukrtatnafta and Zaporizhtransformator., Some of them hardly worked. Now all of them will work. For defense. This is the repair and production of equipment, provision of the defense forces, and restoration of our infrastructure. A complex task that can be accomplished only through the system of military-state management., I do not rule out other similar decisions either., I delivered an important international address today. Climate summit in Egypt. A very significant event, a very representative gathering. Dozens of state leaders and heads of government., The main thing for us is to inform the world about the ongoing Russian aggression, about the destabilizing influence that Russia exerts. When the world is focused on combating war, energy and food crises, the destruction of customary international relations, the climate agenda is clearly suffering. And the destruction of the climate cannot somehow be put on hold..., Therefore, anyone who is serious about the climate agenda should also be serious about the need to immediately stop Russian aggression, restore our territorial integrity, and force Russia into genuine peace negotiations., Into such negotiations, which we have repeatedly proposed, and to which we always received insane Russian responses with new terrorist attacks, shelling or blackmail. , Once again - restoration of territorial integrity, respect for the UN Charter, compensation for all damages caused by the war, punishment of every war criminal and guarantees that this will not happen again. These are completely understandable conditions., Today I signed the decree on awarding our heroes. 396 Ukrainian servicemen were honored with state awards., Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine! , Thank you to everyone who works for our victory!, Thank you to all our partners who help us defend freedom! , Glory to Ukraine!"
6 November 2022  - 21:22 ,Anyone who helps Russia prolong the war should bear responsibility for the consequences along with it - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today I spoke with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. It was a very productive conversation. Working conversation. We have got confirmation from the President regarding macro-financial support for Ukraine - until the end of this year and next year. The scope and details of this program will be presented by our European friends already in the upcoming week., We also talked about assistance in restoring our energy sector and energy infrastructure. I am also grateful for the full support of our efforts to preserve the grain export initiative., Of course, increasing pressure on the Iranian regime was discussed today with Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen. Its complicity in Russian terror must be punished. And we will bring this issue not only to the level of our traditional partners. The whole world will know that the Iranian regime helps Russia prolong this war, and therefore prolong the effect of those threats to the world provoked precisely by the Russian war. If it was not for the Iranian supply of weapons to the aggressor, we would be closer to peace now. And this means closer to a complete solution to the food crisis. Closer to solving the cost of living crisis. Closer to stabilization at the energy market. Closer to reliable security against radiation blackmail, which Russia does not give up. Therefore, absolutely everyone who helps Russia prolong this war must bear responsibility for the consequences of this war along with it., Today, the occupiers used Iranian attack drones again. There are downed ones. But, unfortunately, there are also hits., We also understand that the terrorist state is concentrating forces and means for a possible repetition of mass attacks on our infrastructure. First of all, energy. In particular, for this, Russia needs Iranian missiles., We are preparing to respond., But also, please note: more and more often there are reports that not a single Kalibr carrier has gone on combat duty in the Black Sea. This is a significant result, which was ensured by our defenders. The smaller the Russian Black Sea fleet, the safer it is in the Black Sea. And there will definitely be a day when we will announce that we have provided Ukraine with full protection from the Russian threat both at sea and in the sky. I am sure of it., Very fierce Russian attacks in the Donetsk region continue. The enemy suffers serious losses there, but despite everything, despite any losses, he continues to drive his mobilized soldiers and mercenaries to their deaths., I thank all our warriors who withstand this terrible pressure, who remain steadfast and heroically defend our positions., And I especially want to single out today the fighters of the 79th separate airborne assault brigade for their bravery and heroism during the defense in the Avdiivka direction., I also thank everyone involved in eliminating the consequences of Russian terrorist attacks in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, cities and communities of the Dnipropetrovsk region, and Mykolaiv. We will definitely drive out the occupiers, we will definitely guarantee the safety of all our cities, all our communities., As of this evening, stabilization blackouts continue in Kyiv and six regions. More than 4.5 million consumers are without electricity. Most of them are now in Kyiv and the Kyiv region. It’s really difficult., During the week, I had several special meetings with government officials, representatives of energy companies and regional administrations regarding probable scenarios in the energy sector. We consider each scenario in detail and prepare appropriate actions., No matter what the terrorists want, no matter what they try to achieve, we must endure this winter and be even stronger in the spring than we are now, be even more ready for the liberation of our entire territory than now., Every month we have to set difficult goals and, passing through them, become even stronger., Glory to all who fight and work for our victory!, Gratitude to everyone who helps!, Glory to Ukraine!"
5 November 2022  - 19:06 ,"We must ensure full protection of Ukrainian sky, we will do everything for this – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief Staff today – it was quite long, three hours. We analyzed the situation on the front line in great detail – in all directions, on the energy front, the situation on the borders. The Commander-in-Chief, commanders, head of intelligence, Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, head of border guards delivered reports. We know what the enemy is preparing for. We will respond and continue to liberate our land., Everything related to the defense forces supply support was also analyzed thoroughly. These are equipment, ammunition, communication, winter uniforms., Countermeasures against missile and drone terror were considered separately – there are already quite significant results in this, the percentage of shooting down has become higher, but there is still work to be done. We must ensure full protection of the Ukrainian sky and will continue to do everything possible and impossible for this., In the coming weeks, we expect good news regarding air defense and anti-missile defense for Ukraine., By the way, today there were messages from Iran, from official representatives. There they decided to admit that they did supply drones for Russian terror. But even in this confession they lied., We shoot down at least ten Iranian drones every day, and the Iranian regime claims that it allegedly gave little and even before the start of the full-scale invasion. Only during one day yesterday, 11 Shahed drones were destroyed. We know for sure that Iranian instructors taught Russian terrorists how to use drones, and Tehran is generally silent about it., And if Iran continues lying about the obvious, it means that the world will make even more efforts to investigate the terrorist cooperation between the Russian and Iranian regimes and what Russia is paying Iran for such cooperation. There will be no such thing in the modern world that any of the terrorists or their accomplices will remain unpunished., The situation on the front line did not undergo significant changes during the day. The greatest brutality of the occupiers, as before, is focused in Donetsk region. But constant fighting continues in other parts of the front as well – this is more than one thousand kilometers of the line of combat clashes., Today, I would like to pay particular attention to the National Guardsmen who defend our state in Luhansk region as part of the defense forces. In particular, the soldiers of the 27th Pechersk Brigade of the National Guard, who, together with units of the Ground Forces, very effectively erase enemy equipment and the occupiers. Thank you guys!, We are doing everything so that you and all other soldiers have even more opportunities to chase the enemy. And the next weeks will be very important from this point of view – we are working extremely closely with our partners to get more tanks, more ""armor,"" more artillery for Ukraine., I would also like to mention our border guards – those who continue strengthening the borders in Sumy region, Chernihiv region and Kharkiv region despite constant Russian shelling and provocations. In some border areas of our country, terrorists use mortar fire and there is a constant threat of rocket attacks almost every day. Thank you, guys, for your persistence and endurance!, This week it was possible to ensure the continuation of the operation of the grain corridor in the Black Sea. According to the results of seven days, 28 vessels carrying more than 800,000 tonnes of foodstuffs left the ports of Odesa, Chornomorsk and Pivdenny. The destinations are Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Algeria, Oman, Turkey, China and Ethiopia. Moreover, the ship to Ethiopia with 30,000 tonnes of wheat on board was chartered by the UN Food Program. And this is a typical list of countries that consume most of our agricultural exports., It was the example of the grain export initiative by which we showed that the world is capable of guaranteeing stability despite any threats posed by Russia. The world did not succumb to Russian blackmail, key actors acted decisively, and as a result, the aggravation of the food crisis was avoided. This is one of the most significant international results of the entire autumn. When the world is united, terrorists stand no chance., Another proof of the power of real world unity is the work of our charity platform UNITED24. Today is exactly six months after its launch., Nearly $220 million received in donations from millions of people of more than hundred countries. Drones, helicopters, demining machines are being bought for Ukraine, in particular the very effective Armtraс machines, dozens of ambulance vehicles that are already used in the frontline areas. Star ambassadors joined the project: Andriy Shevchenko, Elina Svitolina, Oleksandr Usyk, Demna, Liev Schreiber, Mark Hamill, Imagine Dragons, Barbra Streisand, Scott Kelly and Timothy Snyder., I thank every UNITED24 donor and ambassador, the project team and everyone who helps us defend ourselves against Russian terror!, And, by the way, next week we will launch another fundraising direction – we will raise funds for a fleet of marine drones. I think absolutely everyone understands what this is and what it is needed for, and I am sure that millions of people will support this direction in our defense. Everyone has already seen how it works. And this is only for the protection of our marine water area, we claim nothing that does not belong to us., Glory to all who fight and work for Ukraine!, Glory to every our hero!, Glory to Ukraine!"
4 November 2022  - 22:07 ,"It is good that the world pays attention only to what the terrorist state actually does, not what it says - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today is Railway Worker's Day - a professional holiday of thousands of people who have become a real pillar for our country. For us, the railway is transport, as it has always been, the provision of defense, the supply of everything necessary for society, and the production of defense structures., In the afternoon, I congratulated the workers of Ukrzaliznytsia, presented state awards. I want to once again thank all the railway workers for their conscientiousness, for the fact that they show with their work how the ordinary performance of official duties in unusual circumstances becomes an important part of the movement of the entire nation towards victory in the war., During the day, an air alert was announced several times in most regions of our country. There are downed Shaheds, there are downed Kalibrs. In particular, eight Shaheds were shot down by the unit of the 301st Nikopol anti-aircraft missile regiment. Two Kalibrs were destroyed by the units of the South and Center air commands. I thank you warriors for this result!, In the south, as usual, the fighters of the 59th separate motorized infantry brigade named after Yakov Handziuk have good results. They destroy enemy equipment, Russian manpower. The fighters of the 406th separate artillery brigade are also doing a great job - very precisely., The most fierce fighting throughout this week is concentrated in Donbas - Bakhmut and Soledar. We are holding our positions. And in these and some other directions in the Donetsk region, the Russian army has already spent as many lives of its people and as much ammunition as it probably did not spend in the two Chechen wars combined., But the real level of Russia's losses is concealed from Russian society. They even concealed their mobilization now and are simply lying to people that the mobilization task has allegedly been completed. The truth is, in the regions of Russia and on our occupied territory, they continue to collect people to send them to death., And this absolutely insane stubbornness of the owners of today's Russia is the best indicator that everything they tell some foreign leaders about their alleged readiness for negotiations is just as false. When someone thinks about negotiations, he does not look for ways to deceive everyone around him in order to send tens or hundreds of thousands more people to the meat grinder - mobilized or in the form of some mercenaries., And it is very good that the world perceives Russian rhetoric as it deserves, namely as a lie, and pays attention only to what the terrorist state actually does. Does, not says., We are ready for peace, for a fair and just peace, the formula of which we have voiced many times. The world knows our position. This is respect for the UN Charter, respect for our territorial integrity, respect for our people and due responsibility for terror - this is punishment for all those who are guilty and full compensation by Russia for the damage caused to us., Today we have a very important statement from the ministers of foreign affairs of the G7, a very thorough one. It covers key aspects of the situation in our defense against Russian aggression. I especially want to thank the partners for creating a coordination mechanism to help our country rebuild its critical energy infrastructure., Today we have a new defense assistance package from our American friends. The amount of the package is $400 million. And in particular, it is armored vehicles, which we very much need to move forward at the front. I am grateful to President Biden, the U.S. Congress and the entire American people for the continued and vital assistance., I would like to single out the Netherlands, which announced its next package of military assistance. The amount is 125 million euros. This is, in particular, what will ensure the strengthening of our tank units - together with American and Czech efforts., Jake Sullivan, U.S. President's National Security Advisor, visited Kyiv today. He is constantly working in communication with Head of the Office Andriy Yermak, and this line of Ukrainian-American interaction is very helpful to us in protecting the state. We are working on the issue of air defense and anti-missile defense for Ukraine. Today, I celebrated Mr. Sullivan's personal efforts by presenting him with one of the most honorable awards of our state - the Order of Yaroslav the Wise. And we discussed in detail with Mr. Sullivan how we can further strengthen our interaction., These days, the First Lady of Ukraine and representatives of our government visited Portugal - the Web Summit, one of the most powerful annual events for the global IT industry, took place there. Olena opened the summit with her speech. She called on the IT community to help protect our state, and this requires very technological things. And we feel that there will be a response., In general, Ukraine was represented at the Web Summit by the largest team in history: representatives of leading IT companies, foundations, and more than 70 Ukrainian startups. The IT industry is one of the foundations of the modern economy, and even this year - despite everything - our export of computer services is growing - and significantly compared to the 21st year, and Ukrainian IT companies attracted about $350 million in investments. This is a serious result, but we will do everything to make the result even greater., There was also a meeting of the First Lady with the leaders of Portugal - the President and the Prime Minister. I thank them for the support and willingness to help Ukraine more., And one more thing., November 4 is the day when an important step was taken in the development of our sovereign statehood. 31 years ago, on this very day, the Law of Ukraine ""On the State Border"" was adopted. This is one of the first fundamental documents of restored Ukrainian independence., We remember every corner of our country. We will liberate all our cities and villages, no matter what the occupiers plan to prolong their stay on Ukrainian soil. Ukraine will be free. And our entire border will be restored - both on land and at sea. Both in the east and in the south., Glory to all who bring our victory closer!, Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
3 November 2022  - 22:41 ,To endure Russian energy terror is our national task now - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, First of all, I want to congratulate you on two professional holidays that are celebrated today. This is the Day of Missile Troops and Artillery and the Day of Engineering Troops. I sincerely congratulate all warriors, veterans and relatives of our heroes who serve in these troops., Ukrainian artillery became the strongest in Europe and one of the strongest in the world. It will always be like that. Despite the physical advantage of enemy artillery - simply quantitative - our warriors provide better results. The advantage of our gunners is qualitative - skills, intelligence, faith in themselves and in our country., And I signed the decrees on awarding two brigades with a special award - ""For courage and bravery"". These are the 43rd separate artillery brigade named after Hetman Taras Triasylo and the 44th separate artillery brigade named after Hetman Danylo Apostol. Thank you guys for your precision!, Ukrainian engineering troops are exactly those warriors who make a vital contribution to the advancement of our units, and therefore to the liberation of our territory. They create a material basis for the movement of troops and for the protection of positions - barricades, crossings, demining and much more., I thank all units of these two branches of the troops, each soldier, relatives of our soldiers and all those who support them and who help them., Today, there were various negotiations and meetings to strengthen our state. The visit of the President of Greece took place, and the key meaning of the visit is precisely defensive. We received from Greece the first batch of armored vehicles, which are extremely necessary now., Defense cooperation, strengthening of sanctions against Russia, creation of a special tribunal on the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine were discussed. Of course, we also talked about the reconstruction of Ukraine. All this is a special topic for Greece. The community of Ukrainian Greeks traditionally lives in the south of our country, in many cities and villages, a large part of which was badly damaged by Russian strikes. Many Greeks lived in Mariupol, in the Mariupol area..., I hope that Greece will actively support our efforts to bring all Russian murderers and torturers to justice for what they have done against our people. And when we return the Ukrainian flag to all the cities and villages of the south of our country, we will certainly invite Greece, its companies and specialists to participate in the restoration of normal life in this part of Ukraine., Today I also met with representatives of the US Congress - Senators Chris Coons and Rob Portman. I thanked them for the continued bipartisan support and for the assistance that the United States provides to our country. We talked primarily about an air shield for Ukraine, about how to speed up the liberation of our territory., Challenges in the energy sector were discussed separately and in a very specific manner. Russian attacks on our energy sector, on our energy facilities, do not stop for a single day. Kryvyi Rih was attacked by Iranian drones this night. Such Russian terror must receive - and surely will eventually receive - a powerful global response. I am grateful to our friends in the United States who are helping with this., In general, there is damage to energy facilities in different areas across the country - this is the volume of electricity generation and transportation for millions of people. Only as of this evening, about 4.5 million consumers have been temporarily disconnected from consumption under emergency and stabilization schedules. In particular, in Kyiv and ten regions: Kyiv region, Dnipropetrovsk region, Zhytomyr region, Zaporizhzhia region, Sumy region, Kirovohrad region, Kharkiv region, Chernihiv region, Khmelnytskyi region, Cherkasy region. Blackouts may take place in other regions as well., To endure Russian energy terror and such a challenge is our national task, one of the main ones now. The very fact that Russia resorted to terror against the energy industry shows the weakness of the enemy. They cannot defeat Ukraine on the battlefield, and that is why they are trying to break our people in this way - to humiliate Ukrainians, to strike at the morale of our people, at the resistance of our people. I believe that Russia will not succeed., It is important now to preserve our ability to act together. Therefore, today I want to draw attention to two things. The first is the attention of local authorities. Please ensure that there is no unnecessary use of electricity in all cities and communities of Ukraine. Now is definitely not the time for bright showcases, signs, advertisements and other such lighting., I also appeal to the energy companies - publicly, so that everyone can hear it., Please be more active in explaining to people when and why you disconnect this or that street, this or that district. Now is the time for such microcommunications. People have a right to know. And if consumers contact and report this or that injustice in energy supply, please respond to it immediately. Work together with local authorities., If someone stays without electricity for eight or ten hours, and everything is connected, including street lighting, across the street, then this is definitely unfair. It is necessary to do everything so that disconnections are predictable and completely understandable for consumers., In particular, I spoke today with the President of Moldova about energy challenges. The terrible consequences of Russian hybrid aggression are felt by all Europeans, and the citizens of Moldova as well. We talked with Mrs. Sandu about what we can do together in the interests of our people and for the protection of our states., I also spoke with the President of Indonesia today. The topic is clear - this is the G20 summit, which will begin shortly. This is our effort to prevent a food crisis. And I thank Mr. President for his support in this matter, for his positive assessment of our efforts., There is a conclusion of the IAEA today - it is quite obvious. The organization's mission visited all the objects that Russian representatives mentioned when they told their fantasies about the so-called dirty bomb. We have invited the IAEA to check, we have given them full freedom of action at the relevant facilities, and we have clear and irrefutable evidence that no one in Ukraine has created or is creating any ""dirty bombs"". And the only thing that is dirty in our region now is the heads of those in Moscow who, unfortunately, seized control of the Russian state and are terrorizing Ukraine and the whole world., The important document was prepared and published today by an international group of experts working under the leadership of Michael McFaul and Andriy Yermak. This is a document about absolutely necessary sanctions against Russia in the IT sphere. This is what can really weaken the potential of Russian aggressiveness. IT is used for missile and drone terror, for the production of military equipment, for cyber attacks and the spread of disinformation. That is, it is one of the pillars of the Russian war against Ukraine and freedom in the whole world., We offer a concrete way to break this Russian IT pillar. I am sure that we will complete this task as well - there will definitely be corresponding new sanctions against Russia., And the last point., Today, another 107 Ukrainians were freed from Russian captivity. Six of them are officers, 101 are sergeants and privates. Army, Navy, territorial defense, National Guard, border guards... Many of them were wounded, and very seriously. Everyone is already getting the aid they need., I am sincerely glad that another 107 families have seen their loved ones, and I thank all our team who made this exchange possible: intelligence, the Office, the Security Service, the ombudsman. We will definitely return home all Ukrainian men and women who are in captivity in Russia or in the temporarily occupied territory. We remember each of our heroes., Glory to all who defend our state! Glory to all who fight and work, bringing our victory closer!, As for the front, the guys are moving forward. As for the grain, the ships are on their way. As for the occupiers, they are also on their way... following the warships!, Glory to Ukraine!"
2 November 2022  - 23:04 ,"Grain Initiative will continue, Russian blackmail turns out to be fruitless – address of President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, Today, we have a significant diplomatic outcome for our country and the whole world – the Grain Export Initiative will continue being implemented. Russian blackmail has led nowhere., The UN and Secretary General Guterres personally responded in a principled and effective way. The President of Türkiye, Erdoğan, also participated. Other key international actors also made timely and fair steps., Once again, everyone saw that there is only one threat to global food security in our region, and that is the Russian Federation, and no one else., This entire situation was immediately reflected in the stock exchanges' indicators – we see some decrease in the price of both wheat and corn. Every time Russian blackmail intensifies, food prices rise. And every time the world does not give in to blackmail, foodstuffs become cheaper. And if there was no Russian attack on Ukraine, there wouldn't even be a phantom threat of the global food crisis. Because every Russian missile that hits our ports, grain storage facilities, and power plants that power our agricultural production ultimately affects the standard of living of tens of millions of people in many countries. This includes Egypt, Algeria, Somalia, Sudan, Lebanon, Bangladesh, India, China, Indonesia, Vietnam... This year they overpaid tens of billions of dollars for food – and only because of Russia, only because of crazy Russian aggression that destabilizes international trade., Today, I spoke with President Erdoğan, in particular, about the security of the grain corridor and the Black Sea in general, about the work of the Crimea Platform, about the return of Ukrainian prisoners of war and political prisoners – we remember each and every one who is in captivity, we will release everyone., We also talked in detail about constant Russian provocations, about Iranian drones, about missile strikes by the Russian army. For example, this morning a Russian plane launched cruise missiles near Snake Island, and they actually flew over the grain corridor routes. And every such Russian launch – and they are almost daily – directly threatens food exports. And it is the partners' responsibility to work together to reduce the Russian threat., I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. The agenda of the meeting is quite obvious. This is the situation on the front lines, in particular in Donetsk region, where the fiercest fighting is going on., By the way, I want to commend the fighters of the 10th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade and the 79th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade for their steadfastness in repelling enemy attacks right there, in Donetsk region. It is especially difficult there these days – dozens of Russian attacks every day. Our guys are standing firm and not giving up a centimeter. This is true heroism. And I thank everyone who defends our Donetsk region!, Of course, we also discussed the situation in other areas at the meeting: Kharkiv region, Luhansk region, the south of the country, the situation on our borders. We are strengthening our positions everywhere and working towards the key goal – the complete liberation of the entire Ukrainian land., I held talks with Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain – he was in Ukraine today., I thanked Spain for the new defense aid package for our country. We discussed what could further strengthen our defense. In particular, we are working together with Spain to really provide an air shield for Ukraine., And it is very nice that today famous and talented historian Timothy Snyder became the new ambassador of our charity platform UNITED24. His name is well known in Ukraine. He is one of those who consistently defends the historical truth about Ukrainians and explains to the world why Ukraine is important., Now that Mr. Snyder has joined the fundraising effort to strengthen our anti-drone defense, he will focus on the Shahed Hunter project., I am sure that when we together provide Ukraine with reliable protection against this partnership – the Russian and Iranian regimes – it will be one of the strongest pages of our state history., And one more thing I would like to pay attention to., You probably heard today that the Kremlin is saying that they demanded security guarantees from Ukraine. We should think for a moment about their statements. Two hundred fifty two days ago Russia demanded security guarantees from the United States of America. After eight months of Russia's so-called ""special operation,"" the Kremlin is demanding security guarantees from Ukraine., These are really striking changes. This shows both the failure of Russian aggression and how strong you and I are when we remain united. Millions of Ukrainian men and women who fight and work for our freedom. And millions of people around the world who help us resist Russian terror. Together we will ensure the defeat of the terrorist state and its punishment for terror. And we guarantee that all of Ukraine is and will be free., Eternal glory to all our heroes!, Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
1 November 2022  - 22:47 ,"We will do everything to give people electricity and heat, but Russia will do everything to destroy normal life - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today, I continued our diplomatic activity so that the world reacts strongly to another Russian escalation, to the terror against our energy facilities, and to Russia's attempt to exacerbate the food crisis again., I had a call with French President Emmanuel Macron. I thanked him for the support already provided and informed him about our urgent needs, primarily in defense. There must be an air shield for Ukraine. Today it was clearly said. We discussed with Emmanuel very specific projects both to strengthen our defense and to rebuild the destroyed facilities., The bet of terrorists for the winter is completely transparent to everyone, and this challenge should be viewed precisely as a challenge to all of Europe. Moscow will present any winter difficulties in its propaganda as alleged proof of the failure of a united Europe. Therefore, together we must prove to the terrorists that failure is a word about them, not about Europe., We agreed to hold two very important events. The first is in December in France. The subject covers all the challenges of winter: from energy to finance, from weapons to protecting the sky. And the second event is to convene the business of France and help Ukraine., We talked with President Macron about the situation with our food exports. These days, the movement of ships with Ukrainian agricultural products has continued, primarily thanks to the principles of the partners, namely the UN and Türkiye, which do not accept Russian efforts to destroy the grain agreement., But the grain corridor needs reliable and long-term protection. Russia should clearly know that it will receive a tough response from the world to any steps that disrupt our food exports. This is literally a matter of life for tens of millions of people., In particular, I talked about this with the Prime Minister of Cambodia today. This country now holds the presidency of ASEAN, one of the most powerful world associations. That's more than 600 million people in ten countries. And for each of these countries, the food crisis is a real threat to national security. If food prices rise due to Russian aggression, if there is a deficit in the food market, this will inevitably lead to catastrophic consequences in most ASEAN countries, as well as in other regions of the world. Therefore, pressure on Russia for the sake of guarantees of food security is now needed from everyone - and from Asian countries as well. We work for this., European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson visited Kyiv today. She helped us a lot in the process of Ukraine’s accession to the pan-European power grid. This is what significantly strengthened Ukraine. And now we heard the necessary signals of support from the European Commissioner. We discussed the initiative to create such a format, which, like a military ""Ramstein"", will work for the sake of our common security, but precisely in the energy sphere. Something like an ""energy Ramstein"" - funds, technical support, transformers, generators, energy carriers - this is what is vitally necessary for our defense., Assistance to specific cities and communities was also discussed. Such as Mykolaiv, Nikopol, Kharkiv and others, which are subjected to constant Russian terror - literally every day and every night., I informed the European Commissioner about the liquidation of the consequences of yesterday's massive Russian attack on our energy sector. About our needs due to such strikes. As a result of the visit, we have many working agreements., As of now, we can report that the technical possibility of water supply has already been restored for all consumers in Ukraine. For most, it is also technically possible to supply electricity. Stabilizing blackouts continue in nine regions of Ukraine. Energy workers and local authorities are doing everything to reduce the time of blackouts., It should not be forgotten that restoration work continues without a break in the territories that were liberated from the occupiers: in the Kharkiv region, in Donbas, in the south of the country. For example, gas supply has already been restored for more than 20,000 consumers in liberated areas of the Kharkiv region. Heat supply systems are being restored in Vovchansk, Balakliya and other cities., We will do everything to give people electricity and heat this winter. But we must understand that Russia will do everything to destroy the normality of life., They do not care about the cost of energy terror. If you look at the cost of yesterday's Russian attack alone, the missiles and drones used cost Russia the equivalent of more than 2,300,000 average Russian old-age pensions. And that's one attack! Monthly incomes of 2,300,000 Russian pensioners... Instead of overcoming poverty in their country, the Russian leadership spends everything to avoid admitting a historical mistake they made with this war against Ukraine., They are hopeless on the battlefield. Ukrainian warriors have already proved it. But it takes time, it takes effort, it takes patience to prove that even the hope for winter will not come true for Russian terrorists. I'm sure we'll get through it., I thank everyone who helps Ukraine!, Glory to each and every one who works to bring our victory closer! Glory to all our warriors who are holding their positions, no matter how difficult it may be, and are gradually liberating our land!, Glory to Ukraine!"
31 October 2022  - 22:36 ,Every Russian attack on our civilian objects brings the international consensus on Russia's liability closer - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Currently, restoration work is still ongoing in those regions where Russian missiles hit today. We are doing everything possible to restore energy and water supply. And we will restore it., Russian terrorists do not have such missiles that could hit the Ukrainian desire to live, live in a civilized manner and take care of each other. And if someone over there in the Kremlin listened to their crazy propagandists and decided that the darkness in Ukraine would help put pressure on Ukrainians, then let them not be surprised at their losses when they see how Ukrainians conduct ""negotiations"" in the dark., Today our Air Forces and everyone involved in protecting the skies did a great job. Most of the objects that the terrorists identified as targets were saved. This morning alone, the terrorists used 55 cruise missiles for a massive strike, 45 of which were shot down., I thank all Air Forces Commands for this result: South, North, East and West, as well as all units of the Defense Forces involved in protecting our skies., Plus, four more Russian helicopters were shot down today: three attack Ka-52 and one Mi-8., Of course, we will continue to strengthen our air defense. But already now, for every ten hits, terrorists have to spend at least four times more missiles. Russia has an even worse result with regard to drones, including those supplied by its Iranian accomplices. And the world sees that. It sees that the former ""2nd army of the world"" is no longer even the 22nd in terms of its effectiveness. And we will do everything to make it into the second hundred. And it will be so., I would like to especially mention the units and employees of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, who both last week and today eliminated the consequences of terrorist attacks. They worked even despite the threat of repeated strikes and extinguished dozens of fires., A big gratitude to all energy workers, utility workers, local self-government, regional administrations - to each and every one who restores normal life., The same gratitude to those of our people who, each at their own level, guarantee that there will definitely be a response to the terrorists., There will be a response on the battlefield. And I want to remind you that the total level of personnel losses of the Russian occupiers is almost 72,000., There will be a response to terrorists in international relations as well. Complete international isolation of the terrorist state is just a matter of time., There will be a response in the area of criminal responsibility - everyone involved in Russian terror, everyone who organized, carried out and justified it, will be responsible for it before the international court., Every new Russian attack on our civilian targets only makes the international consensus on Russia's liability easier and closer., And the fragments of the Russian rocket that fell on the territory of Moldova only remind us how important it is to protect ourselves from this evil together - from rashism, which recognizes neither state borders nor human values., Today, the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic visited Ukraine - one of our greatest friends., The Czech Republic currently holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, and this is how Russia treats European structures: during the visit of the Czech representative - 55 cruise missiles. However, no matter what they think in Moscow, Ukraine takes care of itself and does its own thing., Today, we signed a special declaration with the Prime Minister regarding the Euro-Atlantic integration of our country. The Czech Republic has confirmed that it will support Ukraine's membership in NATO. The declaration also contains specific directions of our cooperation for the implementation of NATO standards in Ukraine., We are starting the work on signing such declarations with all members of the Alliance., I had a call with German Chancellor Scholz. I thanked him for the provided IRIS-T air defense system, and informed about the results achieved by the German system. We discussed the possibilities of increasing German support for Ukraine, in particular in the restoration of our infrastructure after terrorist attacks., I also spoke with UN Secretary-General António Guterres. I informed him about the new level of escalation due to Russian actions., Terror against Ukrainian energy facilities, moreover against the background of Russia's attempts to exacerbate the global food crisis, clearly indicates that Russia will continue to oppose itself to the entire international community. And if so, Russia should have no place in the UN Security Council and all other international structures., I am grateful to both Mr. Scholz and Mr. Guterres for supporting our actions aimed at preserving the grain export initiative and preventing the spread of large-scale famine in some regions of the world. It is very important now to prevent this global destabilization that Russia seeks. And we can prevent it., Today I signed three decrees on awarding our warriors. A total of 406 warriors of the Armed Forces of Ukraine received state awards., I would like to separately thank the warriors of the units of the National Guard of Ukraine, who perform tasks in the Donetsk region. They perform them accurately and efficiently. They skillfully defend their positions and put significant pressure on the rashists. Thank you for this, guys!, Thank you to all those who make Russia get used to the idea that neither the army, nor terror, nor anything else will help them conquer Ukraine!, Glory to all our heroes!, Glory to our fantastic people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
31 October 2022  - 21:02 ,Lawyers will put an end to this war after the military and politicians - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the meeting organized by the International Bar Association (IBA),", Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear defenders of the law and human rights!, Greetings to all of you – participants of the International Bar Association meeting and thank you for your attention to the Ukrainian struggle for freedom., This year, your Association celebrated its 75th anniversary. It was on February 17 - a week before the terrible Russian invasion of Ukraine, which undermines the long-term achievements of humanity in the protection of international law and order and peace., This ongoing war in Ukraine has long had echoes in all other parts of the world., Somewhere there are waves of refugees. Somewhere there is a threat of large-scale famine due to the artificial food crisis provoked by Russia. Somewhere there is a brutal cost-of-living crisis that drives millions of people into poverty and destroys the well-being of the middle class even where Russia cannot reach with its aggression., And somewhere there are the toughest possible things. This is happening in Ukraine. Artillery shelling of our cities - hundreds of Ukrainian cities were destroyed, dozens - completely burned. Constant missile and bomb terror. Iranian combat drones that Russia is using against our infrastructure., Millions of Ukrainians suffered losses from this war unleashed by Russia - they lost loved ones, friends, their homes. At least tens of thousands of Ukrainians have already been killed., Of course, we are doing everything to protect our people and oust the Russian invaders from Ukrainian land as soon as possible. We are doing everything to restore freedom to all Ukrainians in all corners of our country. And I believe that we will do it - thanks to our heroic defenders, thanks to everyone who fights and works for the victory of Ukraine., Very powerful assistance is provided by our partners - and I am especially grateful to the United States of America for its leadership in the global coalition formed this year to protect Ukraine and freedom., But I would like to draw attention to the fact that lawyers will put an end to this war - after the military, after politicians. Exactly lawyers., Those who will ensure that all those guilty of terror are brought to justice and that all damages caused by Russia are compensated - at the expense of the assets of the aggressor state itself., It is this kind of justice that should be the end of the evil that Russia has brought., Behind every of four and a half thousand Russian missiles there are people who are responsible for the deaths and losses that those missiles have caused. Behind every mass burial of the victims of Russian torturers, there are savages who are guilty of these murders. Behind every manifestation of Russian aggression there are those who planned it, organized it, justified it and prevented its termination., We have already started working to establish a Special Tribunal to punish Russia for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. This tribunal will happen. We are already cooperating with the United States, with European countries, with the International Criminal Court to punish all Russian murderers and torturers., We have already started the creation of the Compensation Mechanism, which will ensure the confiscation and channeling of Russian assets to compensate for the losses caused by this war., And I invite you to join this work!, This is an opportunity for each of you to help people who have become innocent victims of war as specifically as possible. This is a chance for each of you to become part of the multi-generational global effort to establish the force of international law., Perhaps, right now in this hall, among you, there are those whose names will soon be inscribed in the world history of the protection of freedom and law and order - for all people, for all countries, for all times., I thank you for the already started cooperation of your Association with the Ukrainian Office of the Prosecutor General and for your initiatives that help us fight for justice for all the victims of this Russian terrorist war., I urge you to be active in the future!, Together we can prove that the law is effective, that the law works, that every war crime will be investigated, and every war criminal will be brought to justice., Thank you for your attention! Long live freedom and let justice prevail!, Glory to Ukraine!"
30 October 2022  - 22:48 ,"There were no emergency blackouts in the country today, but the generation deficit persists, therefore frugal electricity consumption should be continued - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today - the 27th since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Russia., Key defense issues were considered: our active actions on the frontline, further liberation of the territory from occupation, supply of ammunition and equipment, repair of equipment, other support for the defense forces, as well as preparations for winter. Of course, the plans of the Russian military were also considered., The Commander-in-Chief, head of intelligence, commanders of operational directions, ministers delivered reports., Every day and without any breaks, we work to speed up the restoration of the territorial integrity of our state. And always at the meeting of the Staff we celebrate the successes of our warriors, the result ensured in the liberation of Ukrainian land. Every time we have reasons to rejoice together with all Ukrainians., Following this week, I would like to celebrate the warriors of the 54th Separate Mechanized Brigade named after Hetman Ivan Mazepa, the 5th Separate Assault Regiment and the 10th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade for their bravery and steadfastness while holding the lines in the Siversk direction, as well as the warriors of the 25th Sicheslav Separate Airborne Brigade for determination during the liberation of our territory, for special energy. Thank you, warriors!, The warriors - border guards of the Chop detachment, who are currently protecting our state in the Donetsk region as part of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, showed themselves perfectly. Today, they stopped the enemy's brutal assault - the Russian attack was repulsed. In addition, they managed to replenish our exchange fund. Thanks guys!, The Air Forces also have a result: today there is a downed Russian attack helicopter and a downed Russian aircraft - Su-25., Russian terrorists continued shelling in various directions: Chernihiv region, Kharkiv region, Donbas, Dnipropetrovsk region, Zaporizhzhia and the region, Mykolaiv and the region... We respond to the occupiers. We respond tangibly., In general, there were no emergency blackouts throughout the country today - we managed to restore the technical possibility of energy supply after the Russian strikes that took place during the week. But generation deficits still persist, so extremely frugal electricity consumption and stabilization restrictions must be continued., And please be especially careful on the roads at night. There have already been many appeals, in particular from the National Police, regarding the need for pedestrians to have reflective elements on their clothing. This is very important for both children and adults. But it is no less important that drivers have a conscientious attitude., Now you should not just follow the speed regime, but also reduce the speed additionally, especially in those places where there are unregulated pedestrian crossings. Please take care of the safety of others., And, by the way, today I want to congratulate all Ukrainian motorists - not only civilians, but also military - on the Day of Motorists and Road Workers., Usually they wish you a good road. And I know that this road of ours, although not easy, definitely leads to our joint victory. Congratulations!, Another vessel chartered by the UN Food Program has already been loaded in the port of Chornomorsk. This is a bulk carrier carrying 40,000 tons of wheat for Ethiopia, a country experiencing a severe food situation. Ethiopia is on the brink of famine. This is a problem not only of rising food prices, but also of a physical shortage of food., We are ready to release this vessel into the sea, like all others that left the ports of the Great Odesa during the grain export initiative. But this bulker with wheat for the UN Food Program and other vessels with agricultural products are forced to wait, because Russia is blackmailing the world with hunger., What did the world hear? That someone allegedly launches drones from a bulker... At first they talked about ""war birds"", then - ""war insects"", now - ""war grain""... A killer wheat, which drowns Russian admirals. Well, what can you say? They are truly sick people. But these sick people are once again putting the world on the brink of a severe food crisis., Russia is the only one to blame for the fact that food will now become more expensive for people across a vast expanse from West Africa to East Asia. Russia is the reason why people, in particular, in Ethiopia, Yemen or Somalia, are left with a catastrophic food shortage., Of course, the partners are trying to convince the terrorist state to slow down the blackmail a little. But is it realistic? So far, the facts indicate that the Russian leadership is more interested in exacerbating the food crisis than in implementing the signed documents. And this, by the way, is the answer to all those who talk about negotiations with Russia., The grain corridor is a very specific example. There are now 218 pieces of evidence that Russia does not want any real deals. 218 vessels waiting for the opportunity to carry food under export contracts or enter Ukrainian ports. Week after week, Russia has been slowing down the grain corridor despite its own promises to partners, and has now blocked it completely., Ukraine, for its part, will do everything to ensure that the grain export initiative continues to work. And I thank everyone who helps our state!, Thank you to everyone who fights and works for our victory! Thank you to everyone who shows concern for others under these circumstances!, Glory to Ukraine!"
29 October 2022  - 21:37 ,How can Russia be among G20 if it is deliberately working for hunger on several continents – address of President of Ukraine,", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, Today we managed to return another 52 people from Russian captivity: 50 of our defenders and two civilians. Among them are soldiers of the National Guard, the Navy, border guards, security forces..., Andriy Albov is the head of the surgical department of the Mariupol military hospital, he was evacuated from Azovstal. Vasyl Chalenko is a volunteer, security guard, commander of the reconnaissance platoon., Among these 52 are a sailor from Snake Iceland, as well as a National Guardsman who was taken prisoner while defending the Chornobyl nuclear power plant, and a pensioner who earlier worked in the SBU and who was taken prisoner by the occupiers in Bucha., We remember all those held captive in Russia and in the occupied territory, and will do everything to return each and every one., Our exchange team is always working. These are Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Lubinets and others who help. In total, since March, 1,031 people have already been released from Russian captivity. Thanks to the whole team for this result!, I would like to once again commend the work of our energy workers, repairmen, and regional administrations. All those who are working to restore the normal technical possibility of electricity supply after the Russian terrorist attacks., Today, there are significantly fewer stabilization and emergency blackouts – much less. But there is still such a need, and in some cities and districts restrictions are still possible. In particular, it is Kirovohrad region and some other regions., We do everything to make power outages as predictable as possible and so that people can plan their day., Special thanks to those who worked and are working to restore energy supply to the city of Uman and the Uman district of Cherkasy region. There was indeed a difficult situation after one of the Russian strikes. As of now, it is possible to return the technical possibility of power supply., The same situation is in Kyiv region: it was critical, but we are now changing it for the better., I want to emphasize: the return of the technical possibility of supply does not mean that the energy shortage in the system has been overcome. Russian terror continues. It is very cynical. Sometimes it repeatedly attacks deliberately when repairs have begun, when recovery work is in progress. Unfortunately, we have casualties in repair crews, in energy companies. My condolences to their families., Therefore, please – this applies to all Ukrainians – it is very important to be conscious of electricity consumption. This necessity persists. Now we all have to contribute to maintaining the stability of the entire power system., During the week – from Saturday to Saturday – more than 40 Iranian strike drones, a significant number of Russian missiles, six attack helicopters of the occupiers, several of their planes were shot down..., Such a result means hundreds of Ukrainian lives saved, dozens of critical infrastructure objects saved., And as proposed by the military command, today I want to especially note the Odesa and Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigades of the Air Force. Well done, guys! I also thank all our defenders of the sky, absolutely everyone – all anti-aircraft fighters, pilots, mobile fire groups, who are currently performing one of the most important strategic tasks – saving the country from airstrikes by terrorists., Today, a rather predictable statement came from Russia – a statement that they are finally canceling the grain export initiative., But in fact, this is not their decision today. Russia began deliberately aggravating the food crisis back in September, when it blocked the movement of ships with our food., From September to today, 176 vessels have already accumulated in the grain corridor, which cannot follow their route. Some grain carriers have been waiting for more than three weeks. This is an absolutely deliberate blockade by Russia. This is an absolutely transparent intention of Russia to return the threat of large-scale famine to Africa and Asia., Literally today, more than 2 million tonnes of food are in the sea. This means that access to food has actually worsened for more than 7 million consumers., Algeria, Egypt, Yemen, Bangladesh, Vietnam, others countries – very different countries, from different parts of the world... But they can all be equally destabilized by this Russian decision to block exports., I emphasize: this decision was made by Russia apparently in September. Only this queue of ships with food at sea can testify to this.
 It is also important that Russia attacked our Naval Forces at least twice during the grain initiative. Precisely by those forces that guarantee the safety of the grain corridor., A strong international response is needed now. Both at the UN level and at other levels. In particular, at the level of the G20., How can Russia be among the G20 if it is deliberately working for starvation on several continents? This is nonsense. Russia has no place in the G20., All partners see this artificial queue of vessels. They see what Russia did to disrupt the grain initiative. They see that even ships with grain, which are contracted within the framework of the UN Food Program for the poorest countries, do not get a guaranteed opportunity to pass through the sea route., Russia is doing everything to ensure that millions of Africans, millions of residents of the Middle East and South Asia find themselves in conditions of artificial famine or at least a severe price crisis., But why a handful of people somewhere in the Kremlin can decide whether people in Egypt or Bangladesh will have food on their tables? What is it? The world has the power to protect people against this., Ukraine has been and can continue to be one of the guarantors of global food security., Russian terror and blackmail must lose. Humanity must win., I thank everyone who is fighting with us to restore peace and stability to international relations! I thank everyone who fights and works for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!,

29 October 2022  - 11:58 ,It is in Ukraine that the global fate of democracy will be determined – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to US senators and the Yale community,", Thank you so much to everybody for the support! Thank you for the honor of addressing you today., Dear Mr. Rector!, Dear Senators! I also know you well. Thank you for being with us, supporting us in Kyiv., Thank you to the honorable professorial team and students!, Dear friends!, I am glad to welcome you all and thank you for your attention to Ukraine!, I watched this video, a beautiful video made with heart and soul. Beautiful, but at the same time very tragic. You have seen everything and there is nothing to talk about. I think we will be able to discuss and assess this and the details in the questions and answers part of our discussion. However, I also have a short video. I think it will be helpful too., We still have a question-and-answer session ahead of us, so I will try not to waste a lot of time so that as many people as possible can express their thoughts today., , You probably all know what is happening in Ukraine and what a brutal war Russia is waging against us. Tough and cruel., By the way, thanks to the fact that Professor Timothy Snyder works at your university - a very remarkable individual, an outstanding historian – you can easily find out absolutely all the details about why Russia acts in the way it does and why it started acting like that from Ukraine., I will describe the situation in general. For Russia, this is a war not only to seize our land. And not only for breaking our independent statehood, spreading its imperial influence. It's a bit more., With its terror, Russia is trying to destroy what is constantly reborn in our people despite the wars that have taken place, despite the invaders who came here, and even despite the Kremlin's policy of genocide against Ukrainians, which was implemented in the 20th century. And one of its manifestations was, in particular, the Holodomor – the destruction of people by artificially organized hunger., Ukrainians went through very terrible things and still preserved their ability not to obey, their love of freedom and inner confidence that the source of any power on earth is the people. Not a royal throne, not power, not wealth, but people. And it is very important that Ukraine has the potential to protect this fundamental democratic spirit. Protect not only for itself, but also for other peoples in our part of the world., This is where the front line is. And not only for Ukraine!, , It's the royal throne against freedom. The army is made up of those who have been deprived of any freedom during the years of the rule of this Russian leadership, against the defense forces made up of those who know for sure that everyone's freedom makes everyone stronger., Look even at how we differ on the battlefield in Ukraine now., For us, this is a people's war for freedom, and each of the Ukrainian military units has guardian angels in the rear – people who help with everything that may be necessary for our soldiers. We constantly feel this direct connection between the defense forces and society., Do you see something similar in Russia? It is not there. Their people feel a direct connection except with television propaganda of hatred., Our commanders on the battlefield have the freedom to make their own decisions in general defense operations and use that freedom to decide how to operate more effectively at one point or another., Instead, Russian commanders tremble, waiting for orders from above from those who have never seen a battlefield in their lives, and sometimes spend months trying to fulfill orders that are hopeless from the start, simply wasting people's lives, sending them to their deaths, wave after wave., Our defense forces are immediately followed by sappers, rescuers, repair crews, energy workers and all those who have to restore normal life to people. And what does the Russian flag bring to the land where it was erected? Mass graves, torture camps, deportations, filtration camps and total looting., Imagine: Russian occupiers remove Ukrainian books from libraries and destroy them. Everything that can remind of Ukraine is being destroyed in schools as well., , Already 51 Ukrainian universities have been hit by Russian missiles and artillery!, At checkpoints and infiltration camps, Russian soldiers force people to undress to reveal whether they have Ukrainian patriotic tattoos. Even the simple presence of Ukrainian national symbols on the body or, for example, a yellow-blue ribbon on a backpack is a sufficient reason for the Russian military to detain, torture or kill a person. And thousands of such cases have been recorded., Why is this happening?, Because Ukrainian is a target for Russia. Russia is fighting against freedom, destroying Ukrainian and Ukrainians. This is exactly how they see it in the Kremlin – the destruction of the people, and therefore of freedom. They do not believe that it is possible to conquer Ukraine in any other way. And that is why, for example, they went to Iran for weapons, for killer drones and missiles, because Russia lacks its own means of terror, and it simply does not have anything else in its plans or thoughts., Take a look at what the Iranian drones purchased by Russia are sent. They are sent against what enables the people to live: against power plants, boiler houses, transport, even houses. They want to destroy everything Ukrainian, they hate the entire Ukraine – our every manifestation., And this is precisely the strategic threat of Russian aggression. Because according to Ukrainianness, Russia will go to destroy Polish or Georgian life in the same way – that is, the life of other nations on a huge territory – from the countries of Northern Europe to Kazakhstan.
 And that is why we say that it is important for the whole world that Russia loses now – in the war in Ukraine. When we win for ourselves, we will win for other nations whose freedom is potentially under attack: the ambitions of the Russian throne are known., And so that all this does not sound too general, I ask you to watch one video. Video about what we will save Ukraine and other nations of our part of the world from, when we expel the Russian invaders from Ukraine and achieve security guarantees for all of us., , ...This was a picture of our survival under Russian terrorist attacks only during October. And this full-scale war has been going on for nine months., Dear friends!, On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I want to thank your people for the support you provide to our defense. Thank you to your leaders – President Biden, both chambers and parties of Congress, public figures and businesses who feel how important it is for Ukrainian democracy to endure., I am sure Russia has no chance of winning this war and destroying us and any other nation in our part of the world. But the sooner we stop Russia, the more certain our cooperation will be., The more Russian threats, the more our cooperation should be. And the more Russian escalating steps, the more our steps should be in response to defend freedom and people., We cannot slow down the momentum in cooperation and give Russia even the slightest hope that its terror can work. Right now, and precisely in Ukraine, it is being decided whether our part of the world will be free and democratic. Ultimately, this is how the global fate of democracy will be determined., This fate should be determined by you and us – the free world, not Russia and its accomplices. I believe that it will be so!, Thanks again for your attention!, Glory to Ukraine!"
28 October 2022  - 21:15 ,Russia is trying to make the Kherson region literally an exclusion zone; the world must react to this - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, I’ve just finished speaking with the students and educational staff of Yale University, one of the leading universities in the US and the world. Its graduates have a significant influence on decision-making - political, business, at the level of public and international organizations., It is with appeals like this to representatives of Yale University that we expand the circle of those who understand what is happening in Ukraine and help us protect freedom., I will continue this work next week. We will continue to expand our capabilities, in particular through informal diplomacy - through the public in partner countries, through the student community, through professional and business communities., I held talks today with Giorgia Meloni, head of the Italian government. I congratulated Mrs. Prime Minister on her appointment, and discussed opportunities for strengthening our cooperation in various areas, including security, economy, diplomacy, and in particular, the integration of our country into European and Euro-Atlantic structures., I held several meetings with the military regarding the current situation on the frontline, our active actions., Today the enemy reports about the alleged completion of their mobilization... About the alleged needlessness of new waves of sending Russian citizens to the front. , We feel completely different on the frontline. Although Russia is trying to increase the pressure on our positions by using mobilized people, they are so poorly prepared and equipped, so ruthlessly used by the command that it allows us to suggest that Russia may soon need a new wave of sending people to war. We are preparing for this - we are preparing for the fact that the current Russian leadership will look for any new opportunities to continue the war. In particular thanks to its accomplices in Iran., That is why we are working with our partners every day to strengthen our air defense, our other defense capabilities. Every day we strengthen the protection of our critical infrastructure, primarily energy., As of this time, many cities and regions of our country use stabilization blackout schedules - about 4 million Ukrainians face restrictions now. Kyiv and the region, Zhytomyr region, Poltava region, Rivne region, Kharkiv region, Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Cherkasy region, Kirovohrad region. Emergency blackouts are also possible in other regions. We are doing everything so that the state has the opportunity to reduce such blackouts., The occupiers added another challenge - in the occupied territory. Virtually, they are dismantling the entire healthcare system there. The occupiers have decided to close medical institutions in the cities, take away equipment, ambulances - just everything... They put pressure on the doctors who still remained in the occupied areas for them to move to the territory of Russia., First of all, this concerns the Kherson region. Russia is turning the Kherson region into a zone without civilization, without elementary things available in most countries of the world. Before the arrival of Russia, this region, like all other regions of Ukraine, was completely normal and safe, all social services for people were guaranteed there... Life was guaranteed there., And now Russia is trying to make the Kherson region literally an exclusion zone. The world must react to this. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all our representatives inform international organizations and partners about this new escalating step of the occupiers., And I want to appeal now to all our people in these occupied cities and districts: please do everything to help each other - despite any actions of the occupiers. The Ukrainian flag will return. We will return normal life. But you need to endure this time. The time when even formally the occupiers confirm that they cannot stay on the territory of Ukraine, and therefore they already try to steal medical equipment and enslave medical personnel., I thank the United States of America - another package of military aid to Ukraine was announced today. Its volume is 275 million dollars. Much needed items for our defenders that allow us to liberate our territory step by step. It's not just what helps us advance on the battlefield, it's what enables us to guarantee people their fundamental right to life., Today I want to thank Canada - our long-standing and sincere partners. For an unprecedented act regarding the issue of Canada's sovereign bonds, all funds from the placement of which will be directed to help Ukraine. The amount is half a billion dollars. And these bonds will be available for investment not only in Canada, but also around the world. This is an extremely powerful example for all our partners., Canada is the first country to offer such a support tool. Thank you, Justin, Mr. Prime Minister! Thank you, Chrystia Freeland, a true friend of Ukraine!, Glory to all who help Ukraine fight for freedom! , Glory to all our heroes!, Glory to Ukraine!"
28 October 2022  - 00:02 ,"Today we remember the expulsion of the Nazis, approaching the expulsion of the Rashists - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good evening, warriors of light!, Energetic people who are always ready to fight! Its 246th day is coming to an end., We continue our resistance. The aggressor continues his terror. We are again attacked from the sky by a flock of their crows., More than 30 drones were launched in two days. The defenders of our sky prevented the enemy's vultures from breaking into the rear of the country and downed 23 Shaheds. In addition, the Kh-59 guided air missile, two Ka-52 attack helicopters and another Su-25 attack aircraft were turned into scrap metal. In total, during this period, Russia carried out 4,500 missile strikes and more than 8,000 air raids. But we are fighting, we will shoot down more., I thank the guardians of our sky., I am grateful to everyone who participated in the fundraising for the ""catchers"" of such ""Shaheds"". Only on the U24 platform those are 665,000 people from 70 countries. Together, we will certainly clip the wings of all metal monsters, no matter how many of them and from where they fly in the direction of Ukraine. Enemy planes will fall. Enemy helicopters will fall. ""Shaheds"" will fall. It is only the Ukrainian people who will not fall! A heroic people who will definitely go down in world history. Actually, like this day. It is already history., It's already midnight on the clock. October 28 is already on the calendar. Every year on this day, we celebrate the liberation of Ukraine from the Nazi occupiers. We pay tribute to the Ukrainians who fought and defeated Nazism during World War II. Today we do it, holding not flowers in our hands, but weapons. Today, preserving the memory of the exploits of our ancestors means protecting their achievements. We remember the expulsion of the Nazis, approaching the expulsion of the Rashists., Evil, which seemed to have been finally defeated and burned to the ground in 1945, is reborn from the ashes 80 years later. Gets on its feet. It becomes possible. How did it turn out? Imperceptibly. And very quickly. Just as one day changes another. Instantly. A new day and a new evil are coming instantly. At the very moment when the world does not notice. Some are sleepy, some are fast asleep. Some are not paying attention. Some do not care. And in general, everyone is silent and thinks the same: I will not be affected. The war is somewhere far away. Somewhere in Transnistria. This is the problem of Moldovans. Somewhere in Abkhazia and Ossetia. This is the problem of Georgians. Somewhere in Crimea and Donbas. This is the problem of Ukrainians. We will not be affected. It will not cause damage to us. They will not come for us. Unfortunately, as a result, it becomes everyone's problem., Sooner or later, memories of a terrible war become a terrible reality. The neighbor becomes the aggressor. The aggressor becomes a terrorist. And Nazism becomes an example to follow. It may come in a new guise, with new slogans, but with the same goal. Unfortunately, it is not from books that we know about it. We know how evil can break into your house in the last century, eight years ago and eight months ago. Violate the western borders or come from the north, east and annexed Crimea. Attack peaceful cities with bombs or cruise missiles., Mine the Dnipro HPP or seize the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Drop bombs despite the red cross or the ""Children"" inscription. Steal grain according to the ""Hunger Plan"" or threaten the entire planet with hunger., Abduct and deport people. Abduct and deport children. The form of evil has changed, but the essence has remained unchanged., Evil always begins in the same way. The invaders call themselves liberators. The invasion of one's army is called self-defense. As 80 years ago, the Ukrainian people stand up for the defense of their native land. And the enemy's blitzkrieg plan becomes a failure., Evil always acts in the same way. Kills civilians, assuring that it hits military targets only. Arranges blockades and filtration camps. And Syrets becomes Olenivka. Destroys cities and villages. And Koryukivka becomes Bucha., But sooner or later war crimes become known. The reaction of the world becomes painful. The policy of appeasement becomes a tough countermeasure., The evil finds itself in a zugzwang., So evil always ends the same way. The occupier becomes a capitulator. The invader becomes a fugitive. War criminals become defendants, aggression becomes a sentence. Destruction becomes reparations. Enemy equipment becomes museum exhibits. The feats of grandfathers become the victories of grandchildren., The day of the liberation of Ukraine from the Nazis on the 247th day of our struggle becomes a symbol: the result of our struggle definitely becomes the liberation of our Ukraine. The captured territory becomes free. This has always been the case in the past, and will certainly be the case in the future. In the future of Kherson, Donbas, Luhansk, Crimea. Because our land always becomes free. Resistance becomes pride. Struggle becomes victory. And Ukraine becomes united!, Today, Russia's only tactic has become terror. Defeat is the only possible outcome of such tactics. Terror became a proof of their weakness and a test of our resilience., We will not be broken by shelling. The enemy's rockets in our sky are less scarier than hearing the enemy's anthem on our land. We are not afraid of the dark., The darkest times for us are not without light, but without freedom. Our warriors are strong, volunteers are tireless, partners are reliable, and people are indomitable., The second army of the world will become smaller and smaller. The losses of the enemy will become bigger and bigger. I am confident that enemy propaganda does not work, provocations do not work, threats do not scare. Any hard winter will not scare us as well., We know that the darkest night comes before dawn. We know that all invaders flee our land in the same way. Gauleiters and self-appointed ""governors"" end up the same., Reichskommissariats and quasi-republics die equally. And all our cities will definitely have our flags. Both Junkers and kamikaze drones fall equally. And in our sky there will definitely be our birds, our blue sky, our ""Mriya""!, Glory to all who fought against Nazism during World War II! Glory to all who are fighting for Ukraine today!, Glory to our people who will go down in history!, Glory to Ukraine!"
26 October 2022  - 22:39 ,"Ukraine needs victory over Russia, in particular in energy sphere – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, Today I held a big meeting on the energy situation. The participants were government officials, the Office, energy companies, and the State Emergency Service. The topics were diverse. It was recovery of damaged objects, protection of generation, ensuring people's access to energy., The state of nuclear and hydrogen generation was analyzed separately, as well as the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant., Russian terrorists have created such difficult conditions for our energy workers that no one in Europe has ever seen or encountered. There were no such threats that our specialists are forced to overcome now. And they overcome them with honor., I thank all the workers in the energy sector, our rescuers, repair crews, representatives of local governments, private companies who work efficiently enough to maintain the stability of our energy system despite all threats., In many cities and regions of Ukraine, emergency blackouts happen, power consumption has to be limited. But we all have to remember one thing: we need victory over Russia in the energy sphere as well., No matter what the enemy does, our task is to break its plans and protect Ukraine. And this is not just someone's task, it concerns not only energy workers or anyone else. Conscious energy consumption is now needed by all Ukrainians. Please choose your own scheme for limiting electricity consumption while there is a shortage in the general power system., The situation on the front line has not undergone significant changes. The fiercest battles are in Donetsk region: Bakhmut direction, Avdiyivka. The craziness of the Russian command is now most visible there: day after day for months, they drive people there to death, concentrate the maximum power of artillery strikes there. All our soldiers who hold positions in these directions in Donetsk region are simply heroes., Active actions in other directions continue. Today I would like to mention the soldiers of the 25th Airborne Brigade for their bravery in liberating the occupied territories in Luhansk region., In general, we are strengthening our positions everywhere at the front, reducing the capabilities of the occupiers, destroying their logistics and preparing good news for Ukraine., Today, during the day, the air raid alerts sounded several times over most of the territory of our state. The Air Force has results – another helicopter of the occupiers was shot down, another drone., By the way, the total number of downed Russian helicopters is already approaching 250. The Russian occupiers have already lost as much equipment – aircraft and other – as most of the world's armies simply do not have and will never have in service. Russia will not be able to recover these losses. I thank all our fighters for such a gradual and irreversible demilitarization of the enemy., We continue to do everything possible to free our people from Russian captivity. Today, we can finally announce the release of ten more Ukrainians. Our exchange team is working around the clock., And I want to emphasize once again that any of our front-line units can speed up exchanges by capturing the occupiers. The more Russian soldiers are in our exchange fund, the sooner we will return Ukrainians home from Russia., The President of Guinea-Bissau visited Kyiv today. He also chairs the Economic Community of West African Countries. In fact, he is a representative of 15 African countries that are part of this community. And this is the first African leader who visited our country after February 24., In general, we are consistently expanding our contacts with Africa, filling them with new content. Many negotiations and agreements are taking place for the first time in our history. It is very important that on this continent, where the Kremlin's influence is traditionally significant, they hear the Ukrainian position and know the full truth about what is really happening. We provide it., We also work every day to protect our grain export initiative. It is obvious that Russia intends to exacerbate the global food crisis again, to bring back the threat of large-scale famine. And this, in particular, is the responsibility of all our partners – after all, to guarantee food security and end this dirty Russian game with hunger., Today, due to deliberate Russian inhibition of our food exports, the number of ships waiting for the opportunity to meet contractual obligations is already 175. And this is not just some trade problem. This is the deterioration of access to food for millions of people and the threat of an even greater increase in the prices of essential products on different continents – both in Africa, and in Asia, and in Europe. If, after all, Russia succeeds in the negative scenario, it will end in a new large-scale migration crisis., Russia as a terrorist state is a terrorist in everything and deserves daily increasing international pressure on it., I am grateful to those leaders and those politicians who understand and ensure this. I am grateful, in particular, to the Senate of Poland, which decided to officially recognize Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. And such decisions should be adopted by the majority of the countries of the world – Russia itself, by its actions, leaves no alternative., I thank everyone who helps us fight against Russian terror!, Glory to all who fight and work for the freedom of Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
25 October 2022  - 22:46 ,"The sooner peace is achieved in Ukraine thanks to our victory, the less evil Russia will bring to other regions - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today we had a very active diplomatic day, events for Ukraine at all levels - the highest, governmental, parliamentary., In the morning, I addressed the participants of the Berlin conference, which is dedicated to the reconstruction and modernization of our country. This is already the second such conference, after the Swiss one, which took place in the city of Lugano. We are working to obtain resources for the rapid restoration of our infrastructure, social facilities, and housing for Ukrainians., I am grateful to German Chancellor Scholz and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen for making today's event in Berlin very meaningful. We are waiting for specific decisions. Time cannot be stopped, and winter is coming., The Crimea Platform started working in Croatia today - at the parliamentary level., This is an additional and very powerful level of functioning of our instrument for the deoccupation and reintegration of Crimea., The Parliament always embodies democracy, represents different communities of each country. Therefore, when parliaments help restore territorial integrity, when, thanks to parliamentary cooperation, expert work and exchange of experience can be directed in the right direction, it is very powerful., We will definitely liberate Crimea. We will return this part of our country not only to the all-Ukrainian space, but also to the all-European space. This was confirmed once again today. And I am grateful to all our partners - almost 50 states and international organizations - who help in the parliamentary format. I am also grateful to Croatia separately for the hospitality towards our Crimea Platform., Today I held a meeting with representatives of the Jewish community – American, European and, of course, Israeli., We talked primarily about the protection of our people, about the need to make Russian terror impossible and to end this war as soon as possible by guaranteeing complete security and freedom for all Ukrainians throughout the territory of Ukraine., The sooner peace is achieved on our land thanks to the Ukrainian victory, the less evil Russia will bring to other regions, including the Middle East in its cooperation with Iran. I believe that one day Israeli politicians will hear this position, as Israeli society has already done - we feel it., The protection of historical memory in Ukraine was discussed separately. Despite the war, we must continue to implement our programs that restore historical justice. We started the implementation of an important project commemorating the victims of Nazism - the construction of a memorial in Babyn Yar. We will definitely complete it., I held extremely meaningful negotiations with the President of Germany, who arrived in Ukraine. Today, President Steinmeier visited the Chernihiv region - the districts that were under occupation. While he was there an air alert started. And actually the Russian missile terror, the enemy's use of Iranian drones was one of the key topics at our negotiations., We are deeply grateful to Germany for the modern and effective air defense system already provided to us. We are looking forward to new similar systems., We discussed the entire range of our cooperation - defense, political, financial., Significant attention was paid to reconstruction - and I am grateful to President Steinmeier for his willingness to personally patronize this work. We will enhance cooperation with Germany in the field of reconstruction. And at the local government level, it will also receive presidential patronage., And one more thing., Just before recording this address, I spoke with new British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. I believe that the partnership between our countries and the already traditional British leadership in the defense of democracy and freedom will be further strengthened., Ukraine and Britain have achieved the best relations so far, but there is still potential to increase our cooperation to bring more benefits to our societies. I invited the Prime Minister to visit Ukraine., I am grateful to everyone who helps us fight for freedom!, I am grateful to everyone who fights and works for our victory!, I am grateful to all our warriors who are now holding their positions, destroying the occupiers and giving Ukraine the most important feeling: a feeling of confidence in our future., Glory to Ukraine!"
25 October 2022  - 13:36 ,The return of the Ukrainian flag to Crimea will mean the restoration of real peace - President's speech at the first parliamentary summit of the Crimea Platform,", Ladies and Gentlemen!, I thank you for participating in the first parliamentary summit of the Crimea Platform!, I am grateful to our Croatian friends for hosting, thank you, Ruslan, for a strong start!, Thank you all for your kind words about Ukraine and the Ukrainian Crimea, where we will definitely meet again - very soon, I'm sure of it. At the summit of the Crimea Platform, which will mean the restoration of peace on our continent., Peace is what brought us together. What we value. What we strive for and what we cooperate for in different formats and at different levels., Peace… What we all lost in 2014 when Russia started its insane aggression. Started with Crimea., After more than eight years of Putin's war, there are no countries left in the world that would not feel its consequences. It affected everyone - in one way or another., The world is counting losses., What did the Russian enslavement of Crimea lead to, if you look at it from the present day? It was a prologue to a full-scale war that would take the lives of thousands and thousands of people., It was the birth of an anti-human system that tortures, deprives of freedom and injures men, women and children without distinction of age, sex, religion or ethnicity. This was the beginning of the most dangerous chaos in international relations over the lifetime of several generations., All of this was brought by the Russian flag to Crimea and all this is spreading further to the world from the occupied Crimea., The world has become a much more violent place. A place where Russia easily provokes a large-scale famine, as due to its criminal control over Crimea, it has destroyed the freedom of navigation in the Black Sea and can at any moment block our food exports - vital for the world market., The world has become a place where Russia easily and with impunity destroys hopes for stability, for example, in the Middle East and North Africa, because it keeps Crimea as a strategic military base for criminal interference in the situation in these regions., The world has become a place where Russian nuclear blackmail is, unfortunately, commonplace, because this state, in order to keep the stolen territory, threatens the entire humanity with catastrophe., The Russian leadership is trying very hard to show that all this is from 2014 and forever., But that is why we are together so that the brutality and chaos brought by Russia will be truly temporary. Temporary, like the Russian occupation of Crimea., It all started with it. Its return will mean the restoration of true peace. Because the Russian potential for aggression will be completely destroyed when the Ukrainian flag will be back in its rightful place - in the cities and villages of Crimea., Crimea must be freed from its use by Russia as a bridgehead., Then the world will feel that there will be no more losses. And people will feel that the world is becoming safer., Two years ago, when we founded the Crimea Platform, we envisioned a constant expansion of its format. And I'm very happy to see the platform develop in this way., First there was the level of the leaders of the states. Now - the level of legislators and government officials, public figures and experts. And this second level is no less powerful than the initial one. As it makes it possible to attract the democratic power of our societies to respond to each of the challenges that have already been provoked by the Russian occupation of Crimea and that will inevitably arise when it is returned to the legal control of Ukraine., Modern active generations do not yet have the experience of returning such a special territory from the invader to its native state. After all, the ninth year of Russian enslavement continues..., The ninth year of Russia's destruction of the entire international law, all normal economic, social and cultural ties for Crimea. This is what it is now., Crimea is separated by Russia from the very possibility of a normal life., On the territory of Crimea, the occupiers not only committed thousands of crimes... Since 2014, Crimea is the only part of Europe where de facto purges continue - on religious and ethnic grounds. If you are a Muslim, the Russian occupiers consider you guilty. If you are a qırımlı, the Russian occupiers consider you guilty. If you have a Ukrainian passport, the Russian occupiers consider you guilty. Think about it again: people have been living in such conditions for the ninth year already! , And also there is constant Russian militarization of Crimea. And also there is constant deliberate destruction of the Crimean nature by the occupiers. And also there is total lack of guarantees of property rights in Crimea and the looting of Crimea in the interests of the invaders., It will not be easy to reintegrate Crimea after years of such occupation. But due to cooperation, we will manage to ensure this as well. We will change the situation completely. , The return of the Ukrainian flag to Crimea is the return of the normality familiar to all Europeans, as it is available in each of your countries. Security normality, economic, legal, social, cultural., The return of the Ukrainian flag is the arrival of the European Union on the peninsula. In the full sense of these words. All levels of our integration: trade - this is a huge market, investment - these are huge opportunities for development. All this is simply not available in Crimea now. And it cannot be available - Russia has deprived our peninsula of markets and development., The return of the Ukrainian flag is the protection of human rights, it is freedom for all people in Crimea, for all communities - ethnic or religious. It is an opportunity to freely speak your mind and spread the truth about what is happening. It is available everywhere on our continent - from the Atlantic to the Kharkiv region. And it will be available in Crimea., We are already getting closer - every day., And I have just taken part in the work of the Berlin conference on the recovery of Ukraine. Already now, when the war is still going on, and the recovery after our victory. The restoration of our Crimea is being discussed along with the restoration of the whole of Ukraine as an integral part of the valuable, infrastructural, investment and cultural space of the whole of Europe., And we need three things now., At this time, when the restoration of our territorial integrity is still ongoing, sufficient and timely support for our state is needed. Defense, financial and sanctions., I urge you to advocate such support for Ukraine, to constantly strengthen it - it is the foundation of future peace., Then, when we reach our legal state borders and return Crimea in particular, we will need your experience: security, political, legal, economic, social, infrastructural., In order to return full life to Crimea after years of occupation, and justice to the people of Crimea, our cooperation must be maintained at a maximum even after the restoration of our territorial integrity., We should make this format of ours, the format of the Crimea Platform, a starting point for other humanitarian and diplomatic platforms that will promote the de-occupation of other territories that were once enslaved: from Transnistria and Abkhazia to the northern territories., And the third... This is very important., I ask you to promise me that you will definitely visit our Ukrainian Crimea, liberated from the occupiers and peaceful. As soon as we return our national flag there., This part of Europe has been waiting for distinguished guests for too long., Thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! Thanks again to Croatia as the host country for our summit. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister Plenković - I am glad to see and hear you - and Mr. Speaker Jandroković for your hospitality., Glory to Ukraine!"
25 October 2022  - 13:14 ,"By investing in the recovery of Ukraine, you are investing in a future member of the EU - President's speech at the International Expert Conference on the Recovery, Reconstruction and Modernisation of Ukraine",", Good afternoon, dear friends!, I congratulate you on behalf of the Ukrainian people! And thank you for this conference, which brings the return of normal life to our country closer., I have now heard the speech of Mr. Chancellor and I have also heard Distinguished Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen. And then I looked at my speech and realized that we could have exchanged speeches and nothing would have changed. And that's not bad. This means that we see the future of Europe, security, the world, and the future of Ukraine in approximately the same way. But I would like to dwell on some priorities., First of all, I would like to note your words, Mr. Chancellor, which were spoken yesterday. You said that whoever invests in the restoration of Ukraine invests in a future member of the European Union. These are very important words. Significant ones. I believe that they will be heard by all Europeans and global economic players., Your words fully reflect the meaning of our conference and the entire cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union, our country and your countries. We become one - and this is irreversible. A united, strong, free and values-based Europe. Peaceful Europe! This is possible only with Ukraine., I would also like to immediately thank you, Mrs. President of the European Commission, for your sincere and consistent support of our country., I know that you, Mrs. Ursula, share this opinion of Mr. Chancellor regarding the future membership of Ukraine. And I am sure that together with you and all our friends in the European Union, we will soon realize the vision of the majority of Europeans - the vast majority in all EU countries. The vision of Ukraine as part of the EU., Now we have reached the level in relations that Ukraine has long deserved. The importance and scale of our country is being realized. People know what we can give to our common European home. People see what we already give. And all of you - participants of the Conference - know very well what we can give., Ukraine is the physical security of Europe against any new attack of Russian tyranny. It is Ukraine that can guarantee and will guarantee that Russian revanchism will not break our European home., Ukraine is the energy security of Europe - and not only of our neighbors. When we free our entire territory from Russian invaders, the European Union will be able to replace dirty Russian energy resources with our help. And our export of electricity – potentially tens of gigawatts – will be one of the fundamental pillars of European climate policy., Ukraine is already a guarantor of world food security. And therefore, we also guarantee the predictability of migrant flows to the territory of the European Union. The more efficient our agricultural production is and the more important our food exports are, the calmer the social situation is in all those regions of the planet from which waves of migrants to Europe are possible., And one more thing is industrial activity. Our industrial culture, our natural resources, geographical location, and social traditions allow us to give a new impetus to the economic life of the entire EU thanks to the combination of Ukrainian and pan-European potentials. This is economic growth and jobs - for Ukrainians and for all Europeans., You know all this one hundred percent., And you know that this is exactly why Russia needs control over Ukraine. This is not just some political ambition. These are very clear security, energy, food, industrial calculations. Calculations that will not come true for Russia. Never. The Ukrainian people will defend their state, their freedom. And the invaders are already aware of this., This is one of the reasons for their beastly cruelty. One of the motives of their terror is to destroy something that will not work for them, but can strengthen all of us - Ukrainians, Europeans. As a result of such Russian terror, hundreds of thousands of objects were destroyed., A port or a train station, a school or a hospital, a residential building or a car service station, a factory or a bakery, a grain elevator or a power plant... Russia destroys all of this. , Destroys to make it harder for us to endure this winter. So that Ukrainians could not recover from this war for as long as possible. So that you will not be able to integrate the Ukrainian economic potential and the pan-European potential for as long as possible., Missiles and Iranian combat drones have destroyed more than a third of the energy industry alone... And this is before winter!, We must stand together against it. This is how I perceive the mission of this conference. And I urge you to consider all this from the point of view of security - its four elements., We need security on land. We work for it together, establishing defense cooperation. We need security in the sky. And we work for it, negotiating the supply of air defense systems. We need financial security and we work for it at many levels - the IMF, the World Bank, the European Union, the United States and other partners. And the fourth level is our institutional capacity. The way we implement all our reinforcement programs and reconstruction programs now, while the war is still going on, and those designed for the post-war period., And I urge you now to focus not only on the fourth element - “how”. But remember the third element as well - “what”. We need to fill our work with real funding - for the sake of restoring Ukraine., I thank you - the European Union as a whole and each EU country in particular that helps - for the support already provided to our state. However, we should give this support a more systemic character., I believe that we can now adopt a decision on the establishment of a ""financial Ramstein"" to maintain our common stability - by analogy with the ""defense Ramstein"" which is already functioning., We need a financial coordination platform that will unite and direct all the efforts aimed at rebuilding our country after hostilities. Consolidation is needed - clear and timely direction of resources. This is exactly how what we talked about in Lugano with President Cassis - at the first conference on our recovery - must continue., We have developed a transparent plan of priority steps in reconstruction - this is what Ukraine literally needs to survive. Not tomorrow, not next year. Not at a conference in Britain... Right now!, The weight of our Fast Recovery Plan is $17 billion for critical immediate reconstruction. These are hospitals, schools, vital transport and energy infrastructure., We have a huge need for housing reconstruction. Where Russian tanks and artillery methodically destroyed cities... Kyiv region, Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Kharkiv region... It is necessary to give people a new foundation for life already now. But can we give it?, We have not yet received a single cent for the implementation of the Fast Recovery! I urge you to bring the necessary decisions closer., In order to speed up the process of involving partners in our reconstruction, I initiated the creation of the Fund for the Reconstruction of Ukraine. As a key institution. It is important that 75% of the Fund's supervisory board will consist of representatives of donor countries. This is transparency, but this is also responsibility. The fund is to start working next month., Likewise, now - already at this Conference - it is necessary to adopt a decision on assistance to cover the deficit of our state budget next year., For Ukraine, this is an unsustainable amount - a deficit of 38 billion dollars. These are salaries of teachers, doctors, social benefits, pensions. Significant funds. But our association is powerful enough to implement such a task as well., This potential is available. This potential exists in particular thanks to the International Monetary Fund and other financial institutions. Our dialogue continues. And I believe that it will develop from abstract numbers to specifics. A specific amount of funding, with specific sources., This should also be discussed today., Especially since the Ukrainian potential is such that we can give much more in return!, This is what Russia is fighting for, this is what reconstruction means for Ukraine, this is what victory means for Ukraine and this is what peace in Ukraine means., Ukraine is a guarantee of security. Ukraine is our joint development. Ukraine is gratitude., When our actions meet our values and our approaches are coordinated, we achieve results that were unimaginable until recently., We have such results on the battlefield. We have such results in economic and social adaptation to war conditions. We have such results in our integration with the institutions of the European Union. And we can achieve them in ensuring the stability of Ukraine and in the reconstruction of Ukraine - already now., Let the aggressor see that his goal is unattainable. And all our common goals are realized., And of course - we must decide on the specifics of how the mechanism of compensation by the aggressor state for all losses caused by this war will work., Russian assets - those that have already been frozen, and those that still need to be frozen, are significant. A significant part of these assets is in the jurisdictions of European countries. We need compensation - and this is fair. And therefore, we need a real, fast, legal mechanism for directing Russian assets to compensate for the losses caused by the Russian war., I urge you to devote time to this issue today as well., I thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support!, Glory to Ukraine!"
24 October 2022  - 22:03 ,"We defended the independence of Ukraine, and Russia cannot change that already, but we still have to go the way to victory - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Strong people of our indomitable country!, Today is exactly 8 months of full-scale war. What has been achieved over this time?, We have defended the independence of our state - and Russia cannot change that already. We are liberating the Ukrainian land step by step. Donbas, Kharkiv region, Kherson region are now heard. But Zaporizhzhia region and Crimea will be heard as well - the time will come and all of Ukraine will be free., Ukraine is breaking the so-called ""second army of the world"" - and from now on, Russia will only be a beggar. They are begging for something in Iran, they are trying to squeeze something out of Western countries making up various nonsense about Ukraine, intimidating, deceiving..., Never again will Russia be a subject that can dictate something to someone. It no longer has the potential to dictate. The world sees that. Russian potential is being wasted now on this madness - on a war against our state and the entire free world., There was gas influence - not anymore. There was military influence - it is evaporating. There was political weight - now there is an increasing isolation. There were ideological ambitions - now there’s only disgust., And this is a very important change in the configuration in our part of Eurasia - the more of its potential Russia loses now, the more real freedom all peoples will get both next to Russia and within its borders. Ukraine - first of all., On February 24, the Kremlin could not even think about it, although they should have. But now, on October 24, there is no Russian official or propagandist who does not understand where all this is going for them. They started to recall 1917 long ago. The feeling of failure in Russia is getting stronger., But, realizing all this, we have no right to relax. We still have to go the way to Ukrainian victory. This is a difficult path., We’ll have to pass this winter, which will be the most difficult in our history. To do the necessary part of the work in autumn, winter and spring in order to get the desired results for the state. To maintain the maximum mobilization of our partners for the sake of the struggle for freedom and not allow our common enemy to split the global pro-democracy coalition., This is what we do, all Ukrainians, Europeans, all people of the world who value freedom., I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today., We help the active actions of our warriors on the frontline, provide them with everything they need, strengthen the protection of infrastructure facilities, and establish defense against missile and drone threats., The military, intelligence, and government representatives delivered reports. Separately and in great detail, we are dealing with the system of territorial defense., I addressed the people of Israel today in the framework of the Conference on Democracy, organized by Haaretz newspaper. This is a very important media - the oldest newspaper in Israel., There I presented the Ukrainian point of view on the rapprochement between Russia and Iran, on why this rapprochement became possible and what threats it poses to our peoples. I called on Israel to join other democratic countries that already support Ukraine., We are preparing for very important events tomorrow. The first is the parliamentary summit of the Crimea Platform. Dozens of partner states, hundreds of politicians and public figures. This will be another step in our preparation for the de-occupation of Crimea., The second event is a summit in Germany dedicated to the reconstruction of Ukraine. We are doing everything to get the necessary resources for the restoration of our country right now, for the development of the social and economic sphere right now. And I sincerely thank all our partners who support Ukraine in this work., And one more thing., Today the world celebrates United Nations Day. It was on this day in 1945 that the UN Charter entered into force. It was not written and adopted as something ritualistic - it is not an empty formality. It is one of the basic documents that should work to maintain peace and international legal order., It should work. And it will work. In particular, we are achieving this through our struggle against illegal and unprovoked Russian armed aggression. Everyone who tries to restore peace for Ukraine is also fighting for peace and security to be possible for all other peoples on earth., And I want to thank Mr. António Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, for our cooperation, for the fact that he truly defends the Charter of the United Nations and global peace., We have already achieved good results together - this is the release of our prisoners who were held in Russia, this is the grain export initiative, which makes it possible to alleviate the acuteness of the food crisis in the world, this is multifaceted cooperation in UN structures. Thanks for all your help with this! And I believe that we can achieve even more., Thank you to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! Eternal glory to our warriors! Eternal glory to our strong people! Eternal gratitude to our friends!, Glory to Ukraine!"
24 October 2022  - 17:46 ,The alliance between Russia and Iran can be rendered meaningless if we act together - address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the participants of the Haaretz Democracy Conference,", Ladies and Gentlemen!, People of Israel!, I am recording this address to you after the regular meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief., The Staff is the highest body in Ukraine, which provides collegial management of the defense of our state. The military, intelligence, heads of special services and law enforcement agencies, the speaker of the parliament, ministers and other top officials - everyone whom the protection of Ukraine depends on, participate in these meetings., It is in this format that we adopt key defense decisions. We listen to the reports about hostilities and the development of our defense operations, about threats to national security. And it is there, at the Staff, that the words that are constantly heard in Israel when you talk about the survival of your state are heard more and more often., These words are Iran, Iranian. Each time they mean something that you all fully understand. They mean a mortal threat., I will give you just one example now., It happened on October 17, when Russia carried out another terrorist attack. That day there were 15 Russian cruise missiles and 42 Iranian combat drones in the sky of Ukraine. Power plants, other critical infrastructure facilities, and even residential buildings became targets., One of these residential buildings is in Kyiv. After an Iranian drone strike, half of the building is gone. Four floors were destroyed - from the basement to the roof. It stood for 120 years. It was built by Ioselian Lev, an entrepreneur at the time, the head of one of the synagogues. The building withstood World War I, waves of terror and World War II. It saw so much and was destroyed by an Iranian drone. Like many, many other objects in Ukraine., Five people died that terrible day. Well... actually, six. A drone killed a young family who lived in one of the apartments of that building in Kyiv - a boy and a girl, the girl was preparing to become a mother., Ukraine is now constantly subjected to such Russian terrorist attacks. The disgusting sound of Iranian drones is heard in our skies every night., In general, according to our intelligence, Russia ordered about two thousand ""Shaheds"" from Iran - one type of Iranian terrorist weapon. And also missiles and other drones. Iranian instructors came to teach Russians how to use drones., How did this alliance of theirs become possible?, I will tell you., Russia loses to us in a real confrontation on the battlefield. Putin's army does not know how to fight. We beat it on our land in such a way that it is forced to withdraw its contingents even from other regions that it tried to destabilize. Pay attention - the Russian presence in Syria has been significantly reduced thanks to our defenders, who are beating the occupiers., But, unfortunately, we do not have our own ""Iron Dome"". We still do not have a modern and effective air defense and missile defense system that could secure our skies. That is why Russia hopes to use terror in the air to compensate for losses on the ground., Russia strikes with missiles like the S-300. It uses them to hit Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and other cities. Every day and every night. To burn cities - house by house, street by street., Where it cannot reach with these missiles, Russia hits with ""Kalibrs"" and anti-ship Kh-101. Kyiv, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro... It destroys energy, transport, food warehouses, shopping centers, and social infrastructure with them., In 8 months of full-scale war, Russia has used almost 4,500 missiles against us. And their stock of missiles is dwindling. That is why Russia went looking for affordable weapons in other countries to continue terror. It found them in Iran., I have a question for you - how does Russia pay Iran for this, in your opinion? Is Iran just interested in money? Probably not money at all, but Russian assistance to the Iranian nuclear program. Probably, this is exactly the meaning of their alliance., And this alliance of theirs simply would not have happened if your politicians had made only one decision at the time. The decision we asked for., Every time we in Ukraine, at the meetings of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, discuss Russian missile and drone terror, we also talk about our partners who already help or can help us protect the sky. Unfortunately, the words - Israel, Israeli - do not sound at that moment., Of course, this is the decision of your state, your Governments. It seems that it was adopted a long time ago - in 2014, when Russia began its aggression against Ukraine. The decision ""not to annoy"" the Kremlin, not to help Ukraine for real. I emphasize - we have been asking Israel for help since 2014. But such is the continuance of politicians., Although if we had immediately secured our skies when faced with a missile and drone threat, Russia would not even have a motive now to go to Iran and offer it something in exchange for assistance in terror. But that's what happened., And I think that this alliance of theirs can still be rendered meaningless. If we act together, with you, in the same way as with other democracies., Ladies and Gentlemen!, Russian officials and propagandists are really frank. They hate that we live freely and protect our culture. They even try not to say the word Ukraine. They want us all dead. The other day, even one of the famous Russian propagandists absolutely openly called to burn Ukrainian children simply in the houses where they live, or to drown them in rivers - as soon as the children say that they are Ukrainians., This is what rashism is. Iran helps rashism by getting something for itself., Many democratic countries help us. But we would also like to get your help., Of course, we will not give up our struggle no matter what. We want simple and clear things: to liberate our land, to guarantee the safety of our people, to give peace to Ukrainians., We will continue our defense and, I am sure, we will defend Ukraine and our freedom. Our common freedom - of all democratic countries., I sincerely thank you for the award with which you honored this struggle of ours., But isn't it time for your state to choose who you are with as well?, Is it with the democratic world, which is fighting side by side against the existential threat to its existence? Or with those who turn a blind eye to Russian terror even when the cost of continued terror is the complete destruction of global security?, I believe that you will give fair answers to my questions. Because these questions, in fact, are not about politics, but about values. About the values that still unite us. They unite us even when we do not agree on politics., I thank the people of Israel for the understanding and help, in particular, medical aid that we received from your society! I am grateful to you and all the Israeli media that spread the truth about this war and condemn Russian terror! I am thankful to all of your people who took to the streets after the start of the full-scale war, and we saw - we are supported in the Promised Land. I believe that we will see support in the sky as well., Thank you for your attention and I wish you all peace and victory! , Glory to Ukraine!"
23 October 2022  - 20:53 ,"Russia brings death and degradation, Ukraine is always about restoration - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today we can already report that in all our regions, which became the target of yesterday's Russian terrorist attack, the technical possibility of electricity supply has been restored., I am thankful to each and every one who worked tirelessly to bring light to people., Of course, in many cities and districts, our energy companies have to apply stabilization shutdown schedules. This is done so that all our people have access to energy - in conditions where it is not possible to produce it in sufficient quantities., Restoring energy facilities destroyed by terrorist attacks is a much longer and more difficult task. But over time, we will provide that, too. Over time..., This time must be passed. Therefore, today and in the future, as before, we should consume electricity very consciously. Please remember to limit the use of unnecessary and energy-consuming appliances., Separately, I want to address community leaders and mayors of our cities: please make sure that energy is not wasted. Now is definitely not the time for bright shop windows and signs. It is necessary to be really frugal with energy consumption in public space., Reconstruction continues in the de-occupied territory. Every day I receive new reports about the connection to gas, water, electricity of hundreds of households in liberated areas. In particular, just today in only two districts of the Kharkiv region, 346 households have gas again. The city of Vovchansk - 750 more households with electricity. The city of Izyum - 300 more households with electricity. This is constant work that does not stop for a single day and continues throughout the liberated territory of Ukraine., Wherever Russia has brought death and degradation, we are restoring normal life. This is precisely about Ukrainians. Where Ukraine is, life is never destroyed. But wherever Russia comes, it leaves behind mass graves, torture chambers, destroyed cities and villages, mined land, destroyed infrastructure and natural disasters. , So when today the Russian Minister of Defense organizes a phone carousel and calls foreign ministers with stories about the so-called ""dirty"" nuclear bomb, everyone understands everything well. Understands who is the source of everything dirty that can be imagined in this war., It was Russia who blackmailed with the radiation disaster at the Zaporizhzhia NPP., This is the trajectory of Russian missiles that goes, in particular, over Ukrainian nuclear facilities., Those are Russian troops who mined the dam and aggregates of the Kakhovka HPP and are blackmailing with their detonation., It is Russia that uses phosphorous munitions, banned anti-personnel mines and the entire range of weapons against civilian infrastructure., Ukraine is always about recovery. Always about life. And there’s only one subject who can use nuclear weapons in our part of Europe, and this subject is the one who ordered comrade Shoigu to call somewhere., If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this. I believe that now the world should react in the toughest possible way. If Russia has prepared another round of raising stakes and another escalating step, it must see now, preemptively and before its any new ""dirt"" that the world will not swallow that., Even the very Russian threat of nuclear weapons - and even more so against our country, which has given up its nuclear arsenal under promises of security from the largest nuclear powers - is a reason for both sanctions and even greater strengthening of support for Ukraine. Because the stronger the support for us is, the sooner this war and any possible Russian threats will end. When a terrorist state raises the stakes, it must feel that it won't work., During the upcoming week, this will be the number one task for our diplomats - to explain what is happening. And I am sure: the world will be with us. The world will understand., It is very important that today the sixth ship with food chartered in the framework of the UN World Food Programme left our port. This vessel is bound for Yemen, with wheat. Ethiopia, Yemen and Afghanistan are three countries that have already received food thanks to our exports and the UN food program., Such programs are exactly what we in Ukraine are thinking about. How to help get out of the crisis - not how to create a crisis. How to help solve a problem - not how to drive someone into a problem. How to restore the destroyed - not to destroy even more., This is what distinguishes Ukraine from Russia. This is what will help us win in the end. Because we fight and work for life., Glory to Ukraine!"
22 October 2022  - 22:10 ,No terrorist attack will stop our defenders – address of the President of Ukraine,", Dear Ukrainians!, We continue eliminating the aftermath of today's terrorist attacks on our infrastructure. The geography of this new massive strike is very wide: Volyn, Odesa, Khmelnytsky region, Kirovohrad region, Dnipropetrovsk region, Rivne region, Mykolaiv region, Zaporizhia region and other places., The main target of terrorists is energy. Therefore, please be even more careful than before about the need to consciously consume electricity. The stability of the power industry of our entire state depends on each city and district of Ukraine., Please limit the use of appliances that use a lot of electricity. And especially during peak consumption hours in the morning and in the evening. Please, pay attention to notices from local authorities and power companies about when there may be stabilization blackouts on your street or in your area. Plan your day with this information in mind., In part of the territory of our country, where electricity was cut off due to today's strike, it has already been possible to restore power supply. Electricity supply has already been resumed partly in Odesa region, partly in Khmelnytsky region, most of Rivne region has resumed power supplies. There are positive reports from other regions as well. But in many cities, in many districts, recovery work is still ongoing. We are trying to return power to people as soon as possible., I want to thank everyone who is involved in this work: energy workers, utility and local government workers, government officials and businesses that also help. Together, we are now showing that Ukrainian life cannot be broken. Even if the enemy can leave us temporarily without power, it will still never succeed in leaving us without the desire to make things right, to mend and return them to normal., And even now – partially in the dark – life in our state, in our Ukraine, is still civilized. Unlike Russia that brings us this terror. They still have the same wildness with electricity there, as in ancient times. Only savages can bring such evil to the world., I want to emphasize: neither this strike by terrorists nor any other similar strikes by them will stop our defenders., Russian propagandists are lying when they say that this terror against our infrastructure and people can somehow slow down the active actions of our military or create some difficulties for our defense. Ukrainians are united and know for sure that Russia has no chance of winning this war. Our defense forces are getting everything they need to defend the country and are pushing forward every day – I emphasize: every day., Our Air Force also shows good results. Of course, we do not yet have the technical ability to shoot down 100% of Russian missiles and attack drones. We will gradually come to this – with the help of our partners, I'm confident of this. But we are already shooting down most of the cruise missiles, most of the drones. Only in the first half of this day, 20 missiles were shot down – Kalibr and Kh-101 missiles, as well as more than 10 Iranian Shahed UAVs., Today, I want to once again thank our soldiers – fighter pilots and anti-aircraft gunners of the West, South and Center air commands, as well as mobile fire groups of all the Defense Forces for the saved lives of our people and the preserved infrastructure of Ukraine., We are preparing the ground for extending the global sanctions policy to all Russian propagandists, so-called opinion leaders and show business representatives who support or justify terror. The International Working Group on Sanctions Against Russia, chaired by Michael McFaul and Andriy Yermak, has prepared an Individual Sanctions Roadmap. It prepared a basic list of all those involved in the spread of narratives without which Russian terror is impossible. We must clearly evaluate such an ""informational and emotional"" component of terror: the Russian army loses and retreats on the battlefield, and therefore the results of terror against our civilian population and infrastructure are presented by Russian propaganda as a substitute for military victories., Also, various Russian newsmen and stars are involved in justifying the criminal attempt to annex our territory and mobilize for war against us, against Ukraine. Absolutely all such persons should receive a full package of individual sanctions so that they cannot do anything in the world at all. We are working on it., Ukraine was very well represented this week in Frankfurt at the largest book fair in Europe and one of the largest in the world. This is not just an event for the publishing business and writers. It is one of the key European discussion platforms and an influential informational event., The First Lady of Ukraine presented her projects supporting education and the cultural sphere there. In particular, the Books Without Borders initiative is to provide children of our forced migrants with books in the Ukrainian language. And also the Ukrainian Bookshelf project, which is already presented in 20 countries of the world., In total, more than 40 Ukrainian publishing houses, famous writers, famous publicists, and historians took part in the Frankfurt fair. I thank everyone who worked in Frankfurt for making Ukraine heard and bringing the message about it there. Every contribution to the world's support for Ukraine is vitally important., I thank everyone who works and helps for our victory!, Eternal glory to all who fight for Ukraine!, Glory to our indomitable people!, Glory to Ukraine!,  "
21 October 2022  - 20:27 ,Russian attempts to exacerbate the food crisis are also aggression against every person on earth - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. The main points of the agenda are quite obvious - the protection of our skies from enemy missiles and drones, the protection of infrastructure facilities, the destruction of the positions of the occupiers, the advancement of our forces and everything necessary to support the army. Military, intelligence, ministers delivered reports., Every day we are bringing the results Ukraine needs both on the ground and in the air. We are also working on the necessary results at sea., The situation around the Export Grain Initiative is becoming more and more tense these weeks. The enemy is doing everything to slow down our food exports. I believe that with these actions, Russia is deliberately inciting the food crisis so that it becomes as acute as it was in the first half of this year., Today, more than 150 ships are in the queue to fulfill contractual obligations for the supply of our agricultural products. This is an artificial queue. It arose only because Russia is deliberately delaying the passage of ships., Every day that ships with food spend in the queue means an increase in social and political tension in the countries that consume our agricultural products. Here are just some of the states to which food exports are delayed due to Russia: Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Lebanon, Iraq, China, Bangladesh, Indonesia. Our partners - the UN, Türkiye and others are fully informed about this situation., During the operation of our grain initiative, due to the Russian slowdown, we under-exported about 3 million tons of food. This is the annual volume of consumption for 10 million people., Russia is doing everything to ensure that at least hundreds of thousands of these people become forced migrants who will seek asylum in the same Türkiye or EU countries, or die of hunger. And we, together with our partners, must do everything so that the grain initiative is not only preserved, but also works at 100% capacity., The right to food and to life without hunger are fundamental rights for absolutely every person on earth. And that is why Russian attempts to exacerbate the food crisis are also aggression against every person on earth., I held a meeting today with representatives of the U.S. Congress who arrived in Kyiv. I thanked them for their continued bipartisan support and for the tremendously powerful things America is doing to help us protect freedom. We discussed the key issue for today - anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense. We also talked about financial support, about our political interaction, about what new anti-European and anti-democratic steps to expect from Russia and its accomplices in terror. We touched upon the topic of Iranian supplies for Russian terror., Today, this terror against our infrastructure, against our energy will be discussed by the UN Security Council. The meeting is convened at the request of our state and will take place at 10:00 p.m., I met with the President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. I thanked her for the help and informed about our new needs that have arisen due to the Russian terror. The EBRD is already providing financial support to Ukrenergo, and has all the data on what steps we need to take to restore energy and social facilities, to build housing for Ukrainians., We agreed upon positions on the eve of the Conference on the reconstruction of our state, which is to be held in Germany on October 25., Today, during the day, an air alert was announced in most regions of Ukraine. There are new downings of drones and enemy aircraft., Active hostilities continue in the east and south of Ukraine. Our Armed Forces retain the initiative., Today I want to commend the fighters of the 25th separate airborne brigade for their skillful and thoughtful actions in destroying the enemy in the eastern direction., I am also thankful to the warriors of the 60th separate infantry brigade, whose units are showing good results in the Kherson region. Only since the beginning of October, the fighters of this brigade ""trophied"" more than 30 units of Russian armored vehicles, a thousand projectiles for tanks and three ""Giatsint"" cannons. All these weapons will definitely help liberate our land., I am also grateful to the fighters of the 59th separate motorized infantry brigade named after Yakov Handziuk. This week, the boys showed excellent results in destroying enemy equipment and ammunition., I also thank the warriors of the 35th separate marine brigade named after Rear-Admiral Mykhailo Ostrohradskyi for their steadfastness in the defense of the regained frontiers., And one more thing. Today, the government made an important decision that affects tens of thousands of Ukrainian students. Those whose home is in the temporarily occupied territory or in the areas near the front, as well as children of fallen defenders of Ukraine, family members of combatants. All of them will be transferred from the contractual form of education to the budgetary one in our universities and colleges. Details of this decision should be made public by the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine., I thank everyone who fights and works for our country!, Thank you to everyone who brings Ukraine's victory closer!, Glory to our best people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
21 October 2022  - 16:39 ,"Do everything to let people know about Russia's terror in Ukraine, spread stories about the victories of freedom - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the Frankfurt Book Fair",", Ladies and Gentlemen!, Dear participants of our meeting!, Thank you for your attention to Ukraine! Your attention means that you really value freedom and are ready to defend it. This is what Europe needs most now - unity in the fight for freedom. And doing more together, as our common enemy is trying to do more every day., Look - two states that have been regular participants before are now absent at the Frankfurt fair. These are Russia and Iran. They are becoming less present in the space of culture, but more present where everything is being destroyed - not only culture, but also life and everything that provides it., I keep getting reports about where Iranian attack drones purchased by Russia have hit. Power plants, water pipelines, ports, railway stations, warehouses with humanitarian aid, residential buildings, schools - everything becomes a target for them..., Instead of exporting culture, Iran exports death. Instead of importing culture, Russia imports death and directs it against us. And not just against Ukrainians. Not only. But against Ukraine as the first battlefield of Russia's battle with a united Europe as of now., And it is obvious. But not everyone admits this obviousness. We must speak frankly - there are still enough figures in Europe who call for ""understanding"" Russia and try to ignore the terrorist policy of states like Iran. There are such people in various spheres - in politics, business, in NGOs and in the media., Why is this possible? What leads to this?, One answer: lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge in the public majority. Lack of knowledge about murders committed by Russia. Lack of knowledge about crimes that combine different anti-democratic regimes. Lack of knowledge about corruption, which has become their tool to lower Europe's vigilance. Lack of knowledge about injustice and lies, which are integral elements of the policy of any terrorist state., When people do not know something, it is easier for politicians to manipulate them. When societies do not pay attention to relations with other states, business magnates can resort to any immorality in these relations. When injustice in a country is not noticed, terror may come from that country., Remember that Russian state killers took revenge on opponents of the government on German streets, too. Took revenge with bullets. But are you safe from explosions? Or from killer drones?, These are not rhetorical questions. Russia has done enough to show that it does not recognize any borders. So I'm asking you - please do everything you can to let people know. Know about the terror that Russia brought to Ukraine. And before that - to Chechnya, to Georgia, to Syria, to African countries, where Russian mercenaries decided who would live and who would die..., Please write about it. Read about it. Do everything so that the Europeans know how many people died in the struggle for the rights and elementary respect that each and every one of you has simply from birth... Died in Russia, in Iran, in other similar countries., Create, print, distribute books about those who weakened Europe with their decisions - due to corruption or simply indifference. Let people know about them. About those who gave strength to terrorist states or even now are trying to do everything so that there is no strong reaction to their terror., And be sure to spread the stories about the victories of freedom. People should know this. They should know that freedom can endure even when it seems to many that it will not. Just as Ukraine endured Russia's attack this year., Europeans should not forget that murderers and torturers are still brought to justice - even if they had considerable power and influence., Remind people about it. Thanks to this knowledge, they will feel that the current perpetrators of the policy of genocide and war criminals can really be brought to justice, too., Knowledge is the answer. The answer to all those who fear, who manipulate and who do not believe. Books, documentary scenarios, articles, reports - all this is the answer., I invite all of you to Ukraine - publishers and authors, businessmen and public figures, educators, journalists - everyone! Look at what our people are going through. What we have already managed to achieve. What threats we still face. Take a look - and tell about it., Tell about it, because it threatens the other nations of Europe as well. As long as terrorist states still exist., Let us do more together than any of our enemies can do together against us!, Thank you again for your attention!, Long live Europe! Long live freedom!, Glory to Ukraine!"
20 October 2022  - 22:39 ,All world leaders should make Russia understand that the terrorist attack on the Kakhovka HPP will be equated to the use of weapons of mass destruction - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today I took part in the meeting of the European Council. The topic of protection of Ukraine and our energy security was among the key issues at this summit. I informed my colleagues about the new terrorist steps of Russia and about our needs to protect ourselves from this form of terror directed against the energy system., Russian troops continue to strike our power plants with missiles and drones. In the end, such Russian meanness will also fail. We are doing everything to get more modern and effective air defense and missile defense systems for Ukraine., And there will be a day when we announce that the Ukrainian sky has become completely protected from Russian missiles, Iranian drones and any other carriers of evil., Russia tried to blackmail Europe with gas and oil, organizes sabotage on underwater gas pipelines and critical cables in Europe, tried and is still trying to freeze people... And what happened?, Russia has only lost its weight in the European energy market, which it has been gaining since Brezhnev's era, and will definitely be treated as the most reckless international criminal. This will remain with Moscow for a very long time even after this Russian leader., Russia is trying to destroy the energy system of Ukraine, to make our people suffer even more, but this only mobilizes the international community to help us even more and put even more pressure on the terrorist state. And all our expenses for the protection of our energy facilities and for the restoration of our infrastructure after Russian terrorist attacks will be reimbursed at the expense of Russian assets., Each of the terrorists will be personally responsible for what he does. Before the court. And the terrorist state will pay for its terror. With isolation, degradation and assets - both of state and quasi-private entities connected with this Russian regime., I informed the Europeans today, during the meeting of the European Council, about the next terrorist attack, which Russia is preparing for at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. According to our information, the aggregates and dam of the Kakhovka HPP were mined by Russian terrorists., Now everyone in the world must act powerfully and quickly to prevent a new Russian terrorist attack. Destroying the dam would mean a large-scale disaster. , Of course, we understand that the occupiers do not care what happens to the territory of Ukraine. With this terrorist attack, they can destroy, among other things, even the possibility of supplying water from the Dnipro River to Crimea. In the event of the destruction of the Kakhovka HPP dam, the North Crimean Canal will simply disappear. And if Russia is preparing such a terrorist attack, if it is seriously considering such a scenario, it means the terrorists are clearly aware that they will not be able to keep not only Kherson, but also the entire south of our country, including Crimea., We must now all together - all Europeans, all world leaders, all international organizations - make it clear to the terrorist state that such a terrorist attack on the Kakhovka HPP will mean exactly the same as the use of weapons of mass destruction. The consequences for Russia should be corresponding., The world must react preventively. This is key now. The principle of preventive response to security threats should finally become one of the basic principles of international politics., Today I had a productive call with the President of Germany. I thanked him and the German people for supporting Ukraine in the struggle for freedom and for the decision to provide concrete assistance to our country., In particular, Germany became the first country to supply us with the modern IRIS-T air defense system. We expect the delivery of other such systems both from Germany and from our other partners., I held talks with the President of Switzerland, who arrived in Kyiv today. This shows the whole world that Switzerland does not remain morally neutral when such a terrorist war is being waged against Ukraine and the whole of Europe. Switzerland has supported EU sanctions packages and provides us with humanitarian aid., The issues of reconstruction of Ukraine and the possibilities of Switzerland to invest in the development of our economy and infrastructure were discussed substantively today with Mr. President., We also discussed the issue of compensation for damages caused to Ukraine by Russian terror. I am grateful that Russian assets worth $6.5 billion have already been frozen. This work must be continued. And this is something in which Switzerland must not remain morally neutral either., The possibilities of Switzerland to help with digitization in Ukraine and restoration of telecommunications systems in the liberated territories were discussed separately and substantively., The situation on the frontline remains difficult. Especially in Donbas - the same Bakhmut direction - and in some directions in the south. But we stand our ground. We defend our land. We move gradually, ousting the enemy. And we will definitely ensure victory for Ukraine., In the evening, I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 148 defenders of Ukraine were awarded orders and medals., Today, at the request of our military command, I would like to celebrate warriors from the 7th anti-aircraft self-propelled artillery battery of the 3rd anti-aircraft missile division of the 1039th anti-aircraft missile regiment. During another Russian missile strike, the battery provided protection in the north of our country and destroyed an enemy missile in the Vyshhorod district of the Kyiv region. Thank you guys for the excellent service and consistently good results! Every downed Russian missile means saved lives of our people., Today we have both downed missiles and downed Iranian drones. Unfortunately, we do not shoot down all of them yet. There are also hits, there is destruction. But we will do everything to provide full protection to our sky., Terrorists always lose. Freedom always wins., Thank you to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine!, Eternal glory to our strong people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
20 October 2022  - 20:06 ,"Russian terror must lose, Ukraine and all of Europe must win - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address to the European Council",", Thank you very much, Charles, thank you very much, dear Mr. President!, Dear colleagues!, I am glad to greet all of you and want to immediately, without wasting time, move on to issues that are vitally important now not only for Ukraine, but also - I am sure - for the entire European Community as well., There is a new escalation in Russian terror. And this requires us to take new steps in response - quick steps in solidarity. Steps that will protect both Ukrainians and all Europeans., The current leadership of Russia has been working for years to turn energy resources into weapons. Fortunately, this plan of theirs fails., Despite the critical dependence of some European countries on Russian gas, oil and oil products, the European Union managed to ensure energy independence thanks to effective leadership both at the EU level and at the level of national governments., European gas storages are full, alternative supply to the continent is established. This is your absolute success., Unfortunately, the very serious challenge of the price crisis, which Russia ignited and fuels to provoke social tension in European countries, still remains. This is Russia's calculated pressure on the family budget of every European family. But I believe that socially just solutions can be found to overcome this challenge as well., You know that Ukraine offered its help so that we could all get through this winter together in better conditions. In particular, we started exporting electricity to the EU - and this was a very significant contribution to Europe's energy and price stability., However, such help of ours became an obvious target of Russian terrorists. Unable to use energy resources as a weapon, the current leadership of Russia has given the order to turn the energy system itself into a battlefield. The consequences of this are very dangerous – again for all of us in Europe., Attacks by Russian cruise missiles and Iranian combat drones have destroyed more than a third of our energy infrastructure. Because of this, unfortunately we are no longer able to export electricity to help you maintain stability., However, this is only part of the problem., Russia also provokes a new wave of migration of Ukrainians to EU countries. Russian terror against our energy facilities is aimed at creating as many problems as possible with electricity and heat for Ukraine this fall and winter so that as many Ukrainians as possible move to your countries. The terrorist state has already worsened the social conditions in your countries - but it wants to worsen it further by provoking a wave of resettlement., This should be answered immediately., The first answer is fundamental - it is air defense and anti-missile defense. We must do everything possible to make it completely impossible for Russia to destroy our energy system with missiles and drones., We have already received a very effective IRIS-T system from Germany. I thank Mr. Chancellor for that. This German system protects not only Ukrainian skies. It protects European stability, limiting Russian terror, which strikes both our country and, in the future, your countries. But we need more air defense and anti-missile defense systems to create a truly reliable air shield., I know that some EU countries have already confirmed their participation in this work. And I urge you to accelerate the implementation of decisions as much as possible. I am now turning to France, Italy, and our other partners – not only in Europe, but also in the United States of America. Not only to those who produce air defense and anti-missile defense systems, but also to those who have the necessary systems. The more protected Ukrainian skies are, the more stable life will be in all of Europe. We have to ensure it., The second answer should be sanctions. New powerful sanctions against Russia and Iran for collaboration with the terrorist state. Although we have destroyed more than two hundred Iranian drones this month alone, and dozens have hit various targets, Iranian representatives are still lying as if they did not provide the drones to Russia., Russia must pay for this terror – and this must be reflected in the ninth EU sanctions package. Iran must be deprived of any possibility or even desire to supply such drones to anyone., It is good that the first step has already taken place - new individual sanctions against Iranian figures and companies have been approved. But a few individuals and companies are not a responsibility yet. More systematic steps are needed., We can, and therefore must, do everything to ensure that this terrorist plan of the Russian leadership also fails. Never again should the energy system of any country turn into a battlefield. Right now, using the examples of Russia and Iran, we can show what awaits any terrorist state if it tries to attack Europeans or any other people like this., Anyone who calls for the mitigation of sanctions against Russia for terror or tries to politically torpedo the sanctions mechanism is not only trying to make Russian terror go unpunished, and not only betrays the memory of the victims of terror, but also makes the entire European Community dependent on the most anti-European power in the modern world. Pay attention to such voices in Europe - they are against Europe., Please do not forget about the aspect with Belarus. You know very well that we are doing everything to prevent the involvement of the people of Belarus in a war against our state. But since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion, missiles have been launched against Ukraine from Belarusian territory, and now Iranian drones have been added. Therefore, sanctions should be added for such an accomplice., And our proposal to send international observers to the border of Ukraine and Belarus to monitor the security situation is becoming more relevant every day., But that's not all., Russia is deliberately creating the grounds for a large-scale disaster in the south of Ukraine. We have information that Russian terrorists mined the dam and aggregates of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. This is one of the large power facilities. The dam of this hydroelectric power plant holds about 18 million cubic meters of water. If Russian terrorists blow up this dam, more than 80 settlements, including Kherson, will be in the zone of rapid flooding. Hundreds, hundreds of thousands of people may be affected., The water supply of a large part of the south of Ukraine may be destroyed. This Russian terrorist attack could leave the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant without water for cooling – water for the ZNPP is taken from the Kakhovka Reservoir. Even the operation of the canal, which was built to supply water to Crimea and which is periodically allegedly ""cared about"" by Moscow, will be completely destroyed. This is the real attitude of Russia towards our Ukrainian Crimea. And in general, the devastating environmental, humanitarian, man-made consequences of this single Russian terrorist attack may become such that it will be called a historical disaster., According to our information, Russia has already prepared everything to carry out this terrorist attack. Ukrainian workers were kicked out of the Kakhovka station - only Russian citizens stay there. They have complete control over the station. It is necessary to act immediately so that Russia does not have the opportunity to realize this catastrophe., An international observation mission to the Kakhovka HPP is needed. It is necessary to return the Ukrainian personnel there and ensure immediate and professional demining of the aggregates and the dam., Russia is doing this in order to organize another false flag operation - to carry out a terrorist attack and blame Ukraine for it. But we know what the truth is., We know that this territory is controlled by the occupiers and what they were capable of already. They themselves will stop at nothing. But we can stop them. We can stop the onset of catastrophic consequences. We can, and therefore we must!, And one more thing. Reconstruction., Whatever terrorist plans Russia and its accomplices may have, we must care about life. When we have reliable protection of the sky - that is, a sufficient number and quality of air defense and missile defense systems - we will be able to guarantee a normal economic and social life in Ukraine. These are opportunities for our cooperation with you - and therefore for economic growth and new jobs. Jobs not only in Ukraine, but also in your countries., When we can guarantee that the Russian terror at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant stopped, we will be able to return to a stable energy supply for Ukrainians, and therefore to the export of electricity to our European neighbors., Under these conditions - a protected sky and protected energy sphere - we will be able to proceed to a larger scale of reconstruction in Ukraine. And it is not just about the economy and the social sphere. It is not just about security. It is also about the prestige of Europe., I hope that in the near future, namely on October 25 in Germany during the Ukraine Recovery Conference, we will discuss how we will together prove that the effectiveness of our unity and our institutions is much more powerful than any anti-European terror. Russian, Iranian or any other., But without waiting for the next week and the start of the Conference, I would like to point out today that we need more support in the implementation of our Fast Recovery Plan. That is, in the priority measures for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the terrorist attacks., You have all this data - what we need exactly. We already have an understanding of the necessary funds. This is 3 and a half billion euros this year and about 14 billion euros next year. And so far we have received zero from these funds. And they are vital. As well as the next tranches of macro-financial aid for Ukraine are vital., Thank you for the funds that have already been allocated, but a decision has not yet been made on the remaining 6 billion from this package - which is critically needed this year. And it is in your power to reach a principled agreement on the provision of this assistance to our state today already., Terror must lose. Ukraine and all of Europe must win., I thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support!, I look forward to prompt and effective decisions of the European Community., Glory to Ukraine!"
19 October 2022  - 23:06 ,"Occupiers will try to recruit men into their army, avoid this as much as you can – address of President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians!, Today was quite a fruitful day., I met with the European Commissioner for Crisis Management. I thanked Mr. Lenarčič for all the assistance that was provided during the full-scale war. We discussed what other humanitarian needs of our people could be met with the help of our European friends. Of course, we touched on the situation with energy., I spoke today with the President of Turkey. I thanked him for supporting our territorial integrity. We discussed the key security issues currently Ukraine and our entire region are facing. The key topics are efforts to further release our people from Russian captivity, defense cooperation, export of Ukrainian food., I held negotiations with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece – he arrived on a visit to Kyiv for the third time since February 24. I thanked Greece for its support in the defense sector. We agreed to strengthen our cooperation in bilateral relations and at the level of the European Union, as well as at the level of NATO., Tomorrow I will participate in the European Summit – I will contact my partners. The key topic, of course, is challenges to our energy, both Ukrainian and European. We will respond to the terrorist threat together., Today, Andriy Yermak met with representatives of the embassies of France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain at the Office and discussed the strengthening of our anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense., We are working to guarantee the complete safety of the Ukrainian sky. We already have significant results: 233 Shahed UAVs and dozens of missiles were shot down during the month. Ten Iranian drones were destroyed today and this is only in the Kyiv direction. Another 11 Shahed UAVs were shot down thanks to the soldiers of the Pivden air command. Thanks guys for the great job!, There are results in other areas as well. But, unfortunately, there are also impacts. We have new damage to critical infrastructure. Today, three energy facilities were destroyed by the enemy., Of course, we will do everything possible to restore the normal energy capabilities of our country. But it takes time. And this requires our joint efforts. Tomorrow they are needed even more than before., There will be clarifications from the heads of regional administrations and government officials, but in general, it is necessary to be especially conscious of electricity consumption from 7 am tomorrow., Please do not turn on unnecessary electrical appliances. Please limit your electricity consumption and use those appliances that consume a lot of energy. Tomorrow, it is very important that the consumption is as conscious as possible, and thus the schedules of stabilization blackouts will be shorter., I held a general meeting on energy issues today – the Office, government, energy companies., We are preparing for all possible scenarios in view of the winter season. We assume that Russian terror will be directed at energy facilities until, with the help of partners, we ensure the ability to shoot down 100% of enemy missiles and drones., Separately, today I want to address our people in the temporarily occupied areas of southern and eastern Ukraine. In the near future, the occupiers will try to recruit men into their army. Everywhere is the same as in Donetsk and Luhansk. Please avoid it as much as you can. Try to leave the occupied territory., If you cannot do this and find yourself in Russian military structures, at the first opportunity try to lay down your arms and come to Ukrainian positions. And most importantly, protect your life. And be sure to help our other people who are close to you. Our common task is to persevere. Stand against these weirdoes…, Russia avoided even the word ""war"" for six months, punished its own people with criminal cases for it, and now it declares martial law in the occupied territory., The occupiers themselves brought the war to our land under their constant false pretense of alleged negotiations, and now they are signing some decrees cementing the war., Well, what can I say? It's just hysterics of the ""Chekist comrades."" Hysterics, which will be greater the closer Russia's defeat is., In the evening, I signed another decree on awarding our soldiers. Seventy one servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards today., I thank everyone who fights and works for Ukraine! I thank everyone who helps our defense!, And I would like to thank separately for the fact that it was the Ukrainian people who this year became the laureate of the special honor of the European Parliament – the Sakharov Prize. This award is given annually to those who have made the greatest contribution to the defense of democracy, human rights and European values. It is really important that all Ukrainian men and women – millions of our people who so bravely defend freedom were recognized in Europe this year., Glory to our beautiful people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
18 October 2022  - 22:16 ,"No matter what the enemy plans and does, Ukraine will defend itself - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Ukrainians!, Today, the battle for a normal life for our people continued., There were new Russian attacks against our energy system. Some of the drones and missiles were shot down. Thanks again for this to our anti-aircraft fighters, our Air Forces. In particular, the 138th Dnipro anti-aircraft missile brigade for shooting down four ""Kalibrs"". Our other defenders of the sky also have good results. Today, I will also celebrate the Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigade for shooting down a Russian Su-25 attack aircraft., Thanks also to our partners - everyone who helps us with anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense. For example, the German ""IRIS-T"" has shown itself very well - it is a really effective system., We are working with partners to provide even more protection to the Ukrainian sky., Over the past day, more than 10 Ukrainian regions suffered terrorist attacks. Zhytomyr region and Kyiv region, Sumy region, Dnipro and Kryvyi Rih, Kharkiv region and Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and other cities of the south of Ukraine, Donbas. Wherever possible, we are trying to speed up restoration work., But now, just like in the previous days, the overall situation still requires a very conscious consumption of electricity and limiting the use of energy-consuming appliances during peak hours., The more conscious our household consumption of electricity is from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m., the more stable our energy system will be. Everyone who follows this simple rule for peak hours helps the entire country., Please explain this to your relatives, friends and neighbors to guide our national unity towards a common and much needed result., Today I had a lot of meetings and communication regarding infrastructure restoration. Another general meeting on the energy situation is scheduled for tomorrow. We are working out all possible scenarios. And, of course, all this is combined with our measures to strengthen defense against drones., We should remember that the very fact of Russia's appeal to Iran for such assistance is the Kremlin's recognition of its military and political bankruptcy., For decades, they’ve been spending billions of dollars on their military-industrial complex, and in the end they went to bow to Tehran to get rather simple drones and missiles., It won't help them strategically anyway. It only further proves to the world that Russia is on the trajectory of its defeat and is trying to draw someone else into its accomplices in terror., We will definitely ensure an appropriate international reaction to this., But now, at the tactical level, the terrorists may still have certain hopes, calculations, new illusions due to Iranian drones. All this will fall apart, just as their previous calculations., 237 days of this war prove that we are able to find an answer to any threats. If we act together - all Ukrainians and nations of the free world., Today we have an important decision from Estonia - its parliament designated Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. And this is another European step to ensure that the actual reality of Russian terror and the European official attitude towards Russia completely coincide. Terror must receive all types of response - on the battlefield, with sanctions and legally. I am grateful to our Estonian friends for this!, We will continue our work at all levels so that other countries adopt similar decisions., I held a meeting on working out in UN structures our draft resolution on the creation of a compensation mechanism that would provide compensation at the expense of Russian assets for all the damage caused by this war. We are gradually moving in this direction as well. The terrorist state will inevitably pay for everything it has done., Another expansion of our United24 platform took place today. This public fundraising platform has already raised more than $200 million from people in dozens of countries., Oleksandr Usyk became the new ambassador of United24. I just spoke with him and thanked him for his willingness to work for Ukraine., Oleksandr will focus on projects devoted to the reconstruction of our country, in particular in the Kyiv region., Let me just remind you that Andriy Shevchenko, Elina Svitolina, Imagine Dragons, creative director of Balenciaga Demna, Liev Schreiber, Barbra Streisand and Mark Hamill are already ambassadors along with Usyk., Today, 2 billion euros of macro-financial aid from the European Union were allocated to Ukraine's accounts. This is important for us - for the social support of our people. We are very grateful. We expect other tranches under this package with a total volume of 9 billion euros., I am grateful to all friends of Ukraine!, I am grateful to everyone who fights and works for our victory!, No matter what the enemy plans and does, our perspective is clear: Ukraine will defend itself., Glory to Ukraine!"
17 October 2022  - 22:27 ,"The fewer terrorist opportunities Russia has, the sooner this war will end - address by the President of Ukraine",", Strong people of the indomitable country!, Today was a difficult day. The morning of a new Russian terrorist attack. Hours of clearing debris and eliminating the consequences of strikes. The evening of battles for Ukraine and news for Ukraine., The next stage of the release of our people from Russian captivity took place - we managed to return 108 Ukrainian women. Officers, sergeants, privates. Army, Navy, territorial defense, National Guard, border guards., 96 are servicemen, 37 of them are evacuees from Azovstal. 12 - civilians., Among those released today are those who were captured long before the full-scale war. We do not forget about any of our people - we have to return them all. And we will return them all., Our exchange team continues this work: Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Maliuk, Lubinets and others., I am grateful to all involved for this success, and I also thank all those who replenish our exchange fund, who ensure the capture of enemies., The more Russian prisoners we have, the sooner we will be able to free our heroes. Every Ukrainian warrior, every frontline commander should remember this., Throughout the day, the clearing of rubble continues in those places where the Russian terrorists managed to hit today., In Kyiv, they killed a young family, targeting an apartment building with an Iranian ""Shahed"". A guy and a 6 months pregnant girl... Vladimir Putin can mark another ""achievement"" - he killed another pregnant woman., In total, four people were killed by this ""Shahed"" alone. There were other hits. More than 25 settlements of our country were attacked this night and morning., Eternal memory to all victims of Russian terror!, Right now there is a new Russian drone attack - there are downings., The world can and must stop this terror. When we talk about Ukraine's need for air and missile defense, we are talking about real lives that are being taken by terrorists. We manage to shoot down some of the missiles and drones. In just 12 hours from 9 p.m. Sunday, 37 Iranian ""Shaheds"" and several cruise missiles were destroyed., But in order to guarantee the protection of our skies and to reduce the capabilities of Russian terrorists to zero, we need significantly more modern air defense systems and a greater missile provision for such systems., And this is not only Ukrainian interest. The fewer terrorist opportunities Russia has, the sooner this war will end., Russia stands no chance on the battlefield. And it tries to cover up its military defeats with terror. Why does it need terror? To put pressure on us, on Europe, on the whole world., Terrorists must be neutralized. This rule applies equally effectively everywhere, and it will affect Russian terror in the same way., When Russian terror capabilities are neutralized by the joint efforts with our partners, Russia will have no choice but to think about peace., And I thank all our Air Force fighters, anti-aircraft fighters, other warriors who are involved in countering Russian attacks! Every Russian missile shot down and every drone destroyed is a life saved., I am also grateful to everyone who is involved in eliminating the consequences of terrorist attacks: our rescuers, policemen, doctors, energy workers, utility workers, heads of local self-government, government officials and business representatives who help., Today's Russian missile and drone attack also caused new power outages, but this is being corrected. Restoration work is ongoing. This form of terror will not give Russia anything even now, when we still do not have a sufficient number of air defense and missile defense systems., But for this our unity must stay maximal. Please take the request of energy providers into account and consciously consume electricity during the hours of peak load on the power system. This will enable the whole country to go through this period more stably., Please help local communities eliminate the consequences of terrorist attacks, if your business has the opportunity to do so. Please take care of your acquaintances and neighbors who are alone and need attention or help, especially the elderly. And be sure to thank those who are involved in the defense of our state and in eliminating the consequences of terrorist attacks, who maintain normal life despite any attempts by Russia to break it., Our unity, our attention to each other, our ability to fight and work together for common interests is a guarantee of Ukrainian victory and the defeat of terrorists. There is no such weapon in Iran or elsewhere that can break a nation that is aware of what it is fighting for and what it will never forgive the enemy for., I spoke today with the President of the United Arab Emirates. I thanked him for supporting Ukraine, particularly at the level of the UN and other international organizations., We discussed the threat posed by Russia to global food security. I assured Mr. President that Ukraine can and will remain a guarantor of food security and, therefore, social stability of all our partners., We are preparing for important negotiations scheduled for this and next week on further defense and financial support for our country., We will do everything for the victory of Ukraine., Eternal glory to all our warriors!, Eternal glory to our strong people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
16 October 2022  - 22:27 ,Anyone who captures Russian soldiers provides an opportunity to release our heroes - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, World Food Day is celebrated on October 16. This day is established in memory of the establishment of the UN special structure dealing with poverty and famine - FAO. This is the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations., For decades, the world has worked to solve the problem of famine. And it is unlikely that any of the founders of the UN could have thought at the time that in the XXI century all of us in the world will again be forced to fight the threat of mass famine, moreover artificial famine!, A famine for which only one country in the world is responsible - Russia - and its terrorist war against the free world., When Russia blocked our Ukrainian ports and disrupted normal food supply chains, it returned the world to a situation as if these decades of work for international food security had never existed., Fortunately, Ukrainian ports started working again for the export of agricultural products. Since July, we have been supplying exactly the amount of food that restores stability to the world market. And precisely to those segments of the food market that ensure the consumption of some of the most fragile countries in Africa and Asia., And although our export capabilities are still far from complete, we managed to export almost 8 million tons of food by sea - that's more than 300 ships. 60% of this volume was directed to Africa and Asia. This is the global mission of our country: and thanks to Ukrainian supplies, entire regions of the world maintain social and political security., And I want to thank everyone who ensures this: first of all our farmers, our transporters, port workers, our diplomats and government officials. Of course, our defenders, who hold the south and restore safety to the sea. And I want to thank our partners who managed to help with this initiative. In particular, UN Secretary-General Guterres and President of Türkiye Erdoğan., We must do everything so that Ukrainian grain exports only expand. These are jobs for our people and export income. Plus funds to ensure a sowing campaign next year. And for the whole world this is one of the key guarantees of stability., The way Ukraine helps maintain normal life in the world only strengthens the reputation of our state and makes it easier for us to establish new ties in different regions. This upcoming week, I expect new international results for our state., And for the past week, it is worth noting the strengthening of contacts with Saudi Arabia. There are significant agreements. Among other things, this is the decision of the partners to provide a package of humanitarian support in the amount of 400 million dollars. It is very important. Right now we have the most meaningful relations with Saudi Arabia in 30 years., The situation on the frontline has not undergone significant changes over the past day. The key hotspots in Donbas are Soledar and Bakhmut, where extremely heavy fighting continues. The occupiers threw everyone they could against our forces, including 2,000 ""prisoners"" - they are among the mercenaries right there., And these are ""convicts"" with long sentences for serious crimes. They are kept at the front not only with money, but also with the promise of amnesty., This is how the Russian state sponsors terror - it looks for murderers in prisons and promises them freedom if they kill again. Does anyone in the world still doubt whether Russia should be officially designated as a terrorist state? I don't think so., I thank all our warriors who are heroically holding their positions near Bakhmut, near Soledar and in all other directions where military clashes are currently ongoing - in the east, in the south of the country., Today, in the Southern direction, I especially want to celebrate the 60th Inhulets Infantry Brigade, the 17th Separate Kryvyi Rih Tank Brigade named after Kostiantyn Pestushko, the 128th Separate Mountain Assault Zakarpattia Brigade and the 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade named after Yakov Handziuk for coordinated actions in the Kherson direction and effective destruction of enemy equipment. I thank you, warriors!, I also thank the Kherson anti-aircraft missile brigade for successfully protecting our skies from Iranian drones and Russian aircraft., Separately, I would like to note today those units that provided us with the result of replenishment of the exchange fund. This is extremely important - everyone who captures the Russian military provides us with the opportunity to release our heroes., I thank the 54th Separate Reconnaissance Battalion named after Mykhailo Tysha, the 80th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade and the 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, which during the offensive significantly increased our ability to return Ukrainians home., We remember our people detained in Russia. We must liberate them, and we must liberate them all, leaving none to the enemy. But for this we need to capture the occupiers - as many as possible., And one more thing worth talking about today., Due to the Russian missile terror in some cities and regions of Ukraine, energy workers have to limit the supply of electricity so that the entire system works stably. But it will be possible to avoid such stabilization blackouts if all of us in Ukraine consciously treat our consumption during peak hours. This is a small thing for every person's life - but extremely tangible within the entire energy system. For example, this Saturday residents of the Chernihiv region limited their electricity consumption by 20 percent. I am very grateful to you. And in general in the country on average - by 10 percent. Kyiv and the region - only by 7 percent. Please do more - if you have the opportunity. From 17:00 to 23:00 we must reduce our electricity consumption. This is a step that, along with others, will ensure the failure of Russian terrorist plans., I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine! , I am grateful to everyone who fights, works and helps for our victory! Unity and joint actions are our strength, the strength of Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
15 October 2022  - 21:05 ,"Only real victories of Ukraine, dismantling of aggressive capabilities of terrorist state are way to peace - address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyi",", Dear Ukrainians! I wish you health!, We have a new defense assistance package from the United States valued at $725 million. These are very necessary things., Ammunition for HIMARS and artillery, anti-tank weapons, anti-radar missiles. I thank President Biden, bipartisan Congress, and the entire American nation for this strong package., We are doing everything to reduce the capabilities of the occupiers, the ability of the Russian army to carry terror through Ukrainian land. We are consistently destroying the logistics of terrorists, their warehouses and headquarters., The total losses of the enemy in terms of killed people are approaching 65,000. So many citizens of Russia gave their lives for the possibility of a handful of people in the Kremlin to ignore reality., And according to the way the Russian ""burial operation"" continues, we can say that even 100,000 dead Russian citizens will not prompt the Kremlin to think a little bit., Only real victories of Ukraine, only real defending of itself by the free world from Russian terror and blackmail – protection with sanctions, protection with help to Ukraine – only complete displacement of the occupiers from Ukrainian land and dismantling of the aggressive capabilities of the terrorist state – all this is the way to peace., Peace will become possible when its terror becomes impossible for Russia., Today and yesterday, various regions of our country were targets of Russian attacks. In particular, by missiles and Iranian drones. Some of the missiles and drones were shot down. But, unfortunately, not all. Unfortunately, there is destruction and casualties., Donbas, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv region, Kharkiv region, Sumy region, Kyiv region, Dnipropetrovsk region and some other regions of our country..., We are doing everything to shoot down more enemy missiles and drones to neutralize more strike positions of the Russian army. And the day will surely come when our state will be able to fulfill this task one hundred percent., Today, I want to thank all our people who are promptly eliminating the consequences of the Russian terrorist attacks: our energy workers, employees of the State Emergency Service, communal services and local authorities, construction workers, employees of the National Police, government officials who coordinate the recovery process., Although in some of our cities and districts the power companies are still forced to limit the supply of electricity to maintain the stability of the system, we are doing and will do everything to restore the technical capabilities for supply., Also, in the liberated areas of Kharkiv region, Kherson region, and Donetsk region (in Lyman, Sviatohirsk) we are working to restore order, social and medical services, energy supply, communication and mail, water supply and gas, where it is possible., For example, they began to restore gas supply to Izium – the first 500 families of the city already have gas in their homes again. Just yesterday, more than 3,000 houses in the Izium, Kupiansk, Chuhuyiv and Kharkiv districts of Kharkiv region were connected to the gas supply. Work is ongoing in other directions as well., I'm thankful to everyone who is returning normal life to Ukrainians!, Active operations continue in various areas of the front. A very difficult situation persists in Donetsk region and Luhansk region. The most difficult is the Bakhmut direction, as in the previous days. We hold our positions., In general, in the east and south, we do everything to make the occupiers feel that they have no prospects. No matter who they send to fight against us, it will only end in defeat for them., Well, I will once again remind the citizens of Russia, who do not want to participate in this criminal war, but who are sent to war, of one possibility. All who surrender themselves to Ukrainian captivity will save their lives. Anyone who continues to fight in the Russian army or among mercenaries does not have such an opportunity., Ukraine will definitely return everything that belongs to it., Eternal glory to all who fight for our country! Eternal honor to everyone who helps us overcome Russian terror! Eternal gratitude to all who work for our victory!, Glory to Ukraine!"
14 October 2022  - 23:12 ,"We must restore peace, secure historic victory for our state, and we will do it – address of President of Ukraine",", Dear great people of the great country!, This day is passing – October 14, our holiday. The holiday of all defenders of Ukraine, the Feast of the Patronage of the Most Holy Mother of God. Day of the Cossacks. The 233rd day of our full-scale defense in the war for freedom for Ukraine., I want to thank now all our people who today congratulated each other, who congratulated our military, all our soldiers., I want to thank those who continued to work today for the sake of our strength., I want to thank everyone who spent this day, like many others, in battle and on guard duty. In Mykolayiv region and Kherson region, in Zaporizhzhia region, in Dnipropetrovsk region, in Donbas, in Kharkiv region. In Odesa region and in the center of our country, in the north and west – in all our regions. Along our state border., I thank everyone who guards our sky, our sea and our cyberspace., And I would like to thank everyone who today, quietly, silently, even in their hearts, but together with the whole country celebrated the Day of Defenders of Ukraine, being in the temporarily occupied territory or forcibly in the territory of Russia. Ukraine remembers everyone. We will leave no one and nothing Ukrainian to the enemy. Let's liberate all ours. We will return everything that is rightfully ours., We know that we can do it. And we must do it. It will definitely be like that. We must restore peace. And let's do it. We must secure a historic victory for our country. And it will be., Look like the enemy is disturbed. Listen to what and how they ask the leader of these terrorists when he does go out to people, to journalists. Russia is already in the atmosphere of its defeat, already in the atmosphere of hopelessness for itself., Yes, they still have people they throw into attacks. They have weapons, missiles and Shahed UAVs, which they use against Ukraine. They still have the opportunity to terrorize our cities and all Europeans, blackmail the world. But they have no chance. And it won't be, because Ukraine is moving forward., Today, I had the honor to present Crosses of Combat Merit and Gold Star orders to our heroes. In total, 483 soldiers were awarded state awards on the occasion of the holiday. Fifteen were awarded the title Hero of Ukraine., I visited our wounded soldiers in the hospital. I thanked the doctors and nurses for their work – great work, professional., I held a meeting of the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. We discussed the situation on the front line, the actions of the enemy and our steps to liberate Ukrainian territory. In addition, the supply of ammunition, preparation for winter. It was a very substantial meeting., Reconstruction work in the regions after the recent series of Russian terrorist attacks continues. The technical possibility of electricity supply has been restored in most regions. Although in some cities and districts, power companies are still forced to use stabilization shutdown schedules., Fifteen objects that the Russian terrorists wanted to destroy have already been completely restored. We will restore all the others., I draw your attention, dear Ukrainians: please, it is still necessary to advisedly limit the consumption of electricity during peak hours so that the entire power system works stably. It is also an element of the protection of our state., I spoke with a friend of all Ukraine –President of Lithuania Nausėda. About our defense needs and further Euro-Atlantic integration., I also held a meeting on the state of the Euro-Atlantic movement of our country and security guarantees for Ukraine. The Government, the Verkhovna Rada, the Office – all are involved., I spoke today with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. We discussed our possibilities to act together in the interests of our states and peoples. I believe that the desired results are possible., Glory to all our heroes!, Glory to our beautiful people!, I'm thankful to everyone who defends and rebuilds, who works and helps, who fights and wins!, Glory to Ukraine!"
14 October 2022  - 09:04 ,Address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the Day of Defenders of Ukraine,", Dear Ukrainians!, Great people of a great country!, On October 14, we celebrate the Day of Defenders of Ukraine. This is the Day of those who fight. This is the Day of what we fight for. This is the Day of what kind of victory we will gain., A century ago, Ukraine honored this Day. And it will honor it a century after us., On October 14, we express gratitude. Gratitude to everyone who fought for Ukraine in the past. And to everyone who is fighting for it now. To all who won then. And to everyone who will definitely win now. Win in such a way that it will crown the struggle of many generations of our people with success. The people who always wanted one thing the most - freedom. For themselves. And for their children. For our culture., The place where I am now points to the origins of our Ukrainian path. These are the slopes of Vytachiv. Here was one of the most ancient outposts of Rus’-Ukraine. Back in the times of Olga, Svyatoslav and Volodymyr the Great. Svyatopolk, Monomakh, Andriy and Oleg were gathering here for the princely congress. Andriy Pervozvanny placed the first cross here. Cossack seagulls used to cross these waters. These shores have seen various invaders and heroes. Here, on the slopes, Taras Shevchenko looked at the Dnipro and the cliffs. This place is a witness of more than a millennium of our history and its important lesson., They tried to capture and enslave the Ukrainian land. They tried to conquer and destroy the Ukrainian people. Both a thousand years ago and in the XX century. But Ukrainians come here. Here they reflect on our history. The Ukrainian language is spoken here. There is a chapel here, built according to Shevchenko's sketch., There were different periods. Various threats. But Ukraine endured. There is one reason for that. Our defenders. Our people who are fighting for their right to life. In Rus’. In Sich. During the national liberation struggle. Against the Nazi occupation. And against the Rashists., It seems that the current enemy in its evil unites all the enemies of our statehood that we faced before. And by defeating this enemy, we will respond to all enemies who encroached on Ukraine - on those who lived, who live and who will live on our land., This will be a victory for all our people., This will be a victory for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Our Ground Forces, infantry. Tankers. Missile troops and artillery., This will be a victory for our Air Forces. Our anti-aircraft warriors. Our drone operators., This will be a victory for our Naval Forces. Our marines. Our airborne assault troops. Our intelligence. Special operations forces. Security Service of Ukraine., This will be a victory for the border guards, the National Guard, the National Police, the territorial defense, and the communications officers., This will be a victory for everyone who will not leave even a trace on Ukrainian soil of that army that flaunted itself as if it was the second on the planet., This will be a victory for those of our heroes who are now in Russian captivity. Those who are now having the most difficult time. It is the most difficult to remain Ukrainian and preserve Ukrainian when they are among the murderers. But we remember. We remember and do everything to return everyone - each of our heroes. We will not leave anyone in captivity., The world sees that Ukrainians do not lose their humanity under any circumstances. The enemy can strike at our cities, but never at our dignity., The Rashists burned down the Skovoroda museum, dozens of churches, hundreds of schools and kindergartens... But they can't do anything against our philosophy. Against what Ukrainians hear, see and know - from a young age., Russian missiles are still capable of driving Ukrainians into bomb shelters, but none of our people shiver there. Ukrainians sing in shelters., We defend our freedom. Our soul. Our land. Our Kyiv. Our Zaporizhzhia. Our Odesa. Our Dnipro and Mykolaiv. Our Kryvyi Rih. Our Nikopol. Our Khmelnytskyi, our Lviv. Our Vinnytsia., What we have preserved and will always protect. Our Zhytomyr region, Kyiv region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region, Kharkiv region., What we did not give away and will always protect. Our Kherson, our Donetsk and Luhansk, our Crimea., We. We all. Great people of a great country. Everyone who fights and works for Ukraine to live. Diplomats who formed the most powerful global coalition in history to help Ukraine. Volunteers who cover any needs - on the ground, in the air, and even in space. Journalists who spread the truth about Ukraine and about this war, who maintain our morale, our confidence, our awareness. Transporters who change supply chains and provide Ukraine with everything it needs. Energy workers who defeat the darkness around the clock. Builders who restore what was destroyed by the enemy. Our heroic doctors. Rescuers. Sappers. Teachers. Civil servants. Local government. Farmers. Industrialists., A nation. A nation that defeats terror. Millions of people who are bringing the crucial day closer, each in his place. Victory Day. The day of victory in the war for our freedom. In the war for independence for all our people in all corners of Ukraine., In the war for the right to life for the people and for the state, whose name is Ukraine., In the war for our values. In the war for our memory and Tradition. The tradition of freedom., In this war, everything depends on you. On what you do. On who you help. On what you gain. On who came to help us., The world stands with us. More than ever in our history. This in particular makes us stronger than ever in our history., But just as at any time in our history, the future depends on specific people., On those who are currently in the trenches and on combat posts. Sons, brothers and fathers. Daughters, sisters and mothers. Ukrainian men and women, to whom I now want to say the main words., You are the most precious thing we have. Each and every one., Rashist tanks, inmates and mercenaries oppose you. Looters, rapists and those who have gone mad from propaganda. Thousands of people whose lives are worth nothing to their state. They are thrown into attacks, they have ""anti-retreat detachments"" behind their backs, they are not counted and are not even taken away when they die. They do not know what to live for, and that's why they lose the life given to them by God so shamefully., And behind you, Ukrainian Warrior, are millions of people who know exactly what they live for. With you, Warrior, in the trenches is our entire state, everything that we have and that is so dear to us. The future of children is with you. The gold of our athletes' victories. Our poetry, art, science. Sophia and the Potocki Palace are with you. Our Khortytsia and our Lavra. Our Heavenly Hundred is with you. And our respect, our faith and our love. Because our state is the mother of all defenders., Behind you is Ukraine, which knows exactly what it wants and values. Behind you is the history that has been coming to these heroic Days for many centuries, so that you, Ukrainian Warrior, will now turn it in the right direction - forever. In the right direction for Ukraine., I know it is extremely hard for you. I know how this enemy puts pressure on you. I know what they do. But I know that you are strong, and we will do everything to make you even stronger., I know that you are confident, and we will do everything to increase your confidence even more., I know that you are bringing victory closer as much as you can, and we will do everything to speed it up., All of us - millions and millions. Great people of a great country!, Happy Defender of Ukraine Day!, Happy Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos!, Happy Day of the Ukrainian Cossacks!, Glory to all our heroes!, Glory to all who fight, work and help! , Glory to Ukraine!"
13 October 2022  - 22:39 ,"Terror must be responded with force at all levels: on the battlefield, with sanctions, and legally - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today I took part in the work of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe - outlined the most important things for us in achieving peace and restoring Ukraine and the international legal order after this war., We also have a powerful response from PACE, which is the first international organization to designate the current regime in Russia as terrorist., It is very important that this is a political signal. A signal to all states - members of the Council of Europe and all states of the world, that there is nothing to talk about with this terrorist group, which appropriated Russia and unleashed the most heinous war in Europe in 80 years., Terror must be responded with force at all levels: on the battlefield, with sanctions, and legally, We will create a special tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine and ensure the operation of a special compensation mechanism so that Russia will bear responsibility for this war at the cost of its assets., I am grateful to all our partners in the Council of Europe who work for justice for Ukraine and our entire continent. I am grateful to our PACE delegation for truly effective work!, I am also grateful to all Ukrainian diplomats and our friends in the world and in the United Nations who helped consolidate the world community of states in such a way that we gained the highest support at the UN General Assembly for the entire time of the Russian terrorist war., The world sees what is happening. It knows the price of the farce that Russia staged in the occupied territory under the guise of sham referenda. 143 UN member states supported the resolution, which protects the basic principles of the UN Charter and condemns Russia for the criminal attempt to annex our territory. This is a record number of states supporting Ukraine today. But I believe that there will be more., Four states came out on the side of Russia - this is very eloquent. North Korea, Nicaragua, Belarus and Syria. Such a list that everything is clear., I am grateful to each of the 143 states!, Today, an important meeting of our team, which deals with the issue of the release of prisoners, took place in the online format with representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross and other international organizations related to this process., Very important things were said. In particular, those concerning the institutional work of the Red Cross to guarantee the safety of those held in Russian captivity., I believe that the International Committee of the Red Cross is not a club with privileges where they get paid and enjoy life. The Red Cross has obligations, primarily of a moral nature. The mandate of the Red Cross must be fulfilled. It is necessary to immediately do what is completely logical for the Red Cross., There is Olenivka. In fact, a concentration camp where our prisoners are kept. Access to them is required, as it was stipulated. The Red Cross can make it happen. But you have to try to make it happen. Ukraine is ready to facilitate this., The mission of the Red Cross can work on the model of the mission of the IAEA. But this requires leadership. Conscientiousness is required. Understanding who and why created such an institution as the Red Cross is required., I am grateful to the team that continues to engage in exchanges: Budanov, Yermak, Usov, Maliuk. Today, we managed to return another 20 Ukrainians from captivity. 14 warriors of the army, four warriors of the territorial defense, one national guard and one warrior of the Navy. We are working on getting everyone back!, Our Air Forces continue the battle for Ukrainian skies. As in previous days, I received hourly reports of downed Russian missiles and drones. During the day, 11 missiles were fired, six missiles were shot down in Mykolaiv, Lviv and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Thank you to everyone who fulfills this task!, We urgently restore damaged infrastructure objects., I also want to celebrate today the warriors of the 5th separate assault regiment of the Ground Forces, the 1st separate battalion of the marines and the battalion of the 4th brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine for their skillful and heroic actions during the defense in the Bakhmut direction., This direction is still one of the toughest on the front. Thank you to everyone who defends our positions there and inflicts tangible hits on the occupiers., Now Russia is sending thousands of its mobilized men to the front. They have no significant military training, but their command does not need it at all. They expect that the mobilized Russians will be able to survive in the war for at least a few weeks, then they will die, and then new ones will be sent to the front. But during this time, such use by Russian generals of their people as ""cannon fodder"" makes it possible to create additional pressure on our defenders., It's a tangible pressure. And I am grateful to all our warriors who endure it. I am also grateful to the partners who understand that in such conditions we need an increase in defense assistance. I thank everyone who fights, works and helps to protect Ukraine!, Tomorrow we will definitely celebrate - everyone in their place - one of our most important days. Intercession, Day of Defenders of Ukraine. The holiday of all our warriors - from ancient times to the present, from the Cossacks to the insurgents, from all of them to the warriors of the modern army., Tomorrow will be the 233rd day of our full-scale defense. And new steps that bring us closer to peace and victory., We do not relax! We beat the enemy! We follow the safety rules! We listen to the air alarm signal, especially tomorrow!, And we do everything to strengthen Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
13 October 2022  - 16:15 ,Speech by the President of Ukraine at the autumn plenary session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe,", Thank you so much for your support and for such profound words. Very clear, important words, actions, messages from you!, Dear Mr. President!, Dear Mrs. Secretary General!, Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, attendees!, Dear Europeans!, I am grateful for the opportunity to address you today., These days, Ukraine wakes up every morning with two questions: what else became the target of Russian terror overnight and where else did our forces manage to defeat these terrorists?, And when I say “these days”, I don't mean two days or a week, or even a month., The Russian terrorist war against Ukraine has been ongoing for 232 days - after 8 years of war in Donbas., I think you are well informed about what Ukrainians have to go through these days. There is no shortage of information in the European media about specific manifestations of Russian terror, about the specific course of this war. The Ukrainian delegation to PACE also works quite effectively, emphasizing what is important for Ukraine and the whole of Europe., So, I will not waste time telling you about new targets of Russian terrorists and events on the frontline., I want to focus on something else - on how and when we will be able to put an end to ""these days""., When the war will end. When peace will come. When our territorial integrity and peace on the entire Ukrainian land will be restored., I remember when I became President of Ukraine in 2019, our state was experiencing pretty complicated relations with the Council of Europe. Then the Russian delegation returned to the PACE hall. In fact, there was an attempt to write off everything that Russia did against Ukraine and European values, starting in 2014. Write off under the guise of stories that it was necessary to maintain dialogue with Russia at all possible levels., Then the word ""dialogue"" masked the desire to turn a blind eye to reality. And even worse, this word masked the desire of some subjects to join the corrupt flow of money from Russia to Europe, which caused a lot of trouble in European politics., There is nothing like this this year. And I am grateful to you for that. Sincerely grateful., When Russia launched a full-scale invasion, you quickly made a principled decision and expelled the aggressor state from the Council of Europe. You also adopted resolutions condemning Russian terror and the crimes of this state against international law. Principles reign at all other levels of European institutions as well., But what does all this actually mean? This is evidence that a real dialogue has finally begun. An honest dialogue. A needed dialogue. And it's not just the word ""dialogue"" that masks something. It is the real search for solutions., A dialogue between Europeans., A dialogue about how to save people's lives and how to protect our values. About how Europe can withstand when everything that is fundamental to peace is attacked and when this attack is carried out not by some marginal political group, which has already happened in Europe, but by the geographically largest state in the world. The state that has been preparing for war for decades and turned the destruction of human rights into its ideology., And we see the historically important results of this dialogue in Europe - between Europeans. We see actions that have strengthened Europe in an unprecedented way., Never in history has a united Europe been as strong as it is now. Focused on everything necessary to prevent Russian terrorists from ruining our lives. This is the power of dialogue., We isolate Russia together. Together we punish terror and make it feel the price for the war it unleashed., Thanks to our dialogue, we have significant defense and financial support programs for Ukraine. And support programs for Ukrainians - those who left their homeland to escape hostilities., Thanks to our dialogue, a lot has been done to protect Europe from Russian energy weapons. What has been called for for decades has become a priority for both national governments and European institutions., And we should continue this kind of dialogue. Dialogue between us. Dialogue with our partners in the world., I ask you at all levels - in politics, in the media, in communication with voters - to defend the provision of Ukraine with a sufficient number of modern anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense systems. Already this year, we need to protect our sky from the terror of Russia. If this is done, it will be a fundamental step to end the entire war in the near future., We must continue our dialogue to further reduce Russia's ability to finance the war. In particular, it is vitally necessary to deprive the aggressor state of profits from the export of oil and gas. Russia must see zero in the accounts to start thinking about the benefits of peace. This should be the purpose of EU sanctions packages., We must continue our dialogue in order to finally find a way to force Russia to comply with the demand of the IAEA and without exaggeration all of humanity - to ensure the demilitarization of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russia must not only withdraw military equipment from there, but also take away all its militants., We must continue our dialogue in order to hold Russia as the aggressor state and each of the Russian murderers and torturers to account for all crimes in this war, for every manifestation of terror. When these legal mechanisms are established and operational, it will be one of the most powerful guarantees of long-term peace., Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Europeans!, This year we saw that Russia deliberately rejects any real dialogue with us. Russia wants to speak the language of terror only. And that's a fact., This fact must be recognized at all levels: politically, legally and on the battlefield in Ukraine - by supporting our defense capabilities. And I am grateful for the fact that the PACE can become the first international organization that designates Russia exactly this way - as a terrorist state., But we also saw the power of a real dialogue between us. Dialogue on how to stop terror., As a result, Europe is much stronger than anyone thought. And potentially, our ability to protect freedom, the rule of law, human rights and social justice is even stronger than we think about ourselves even now., Europe can play a historic role in the creation of the Special Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. Let's do it! This will be the best way to protect the principles of international law., Europe can take the lead in the efforts to compensate for the damage caused by this war. We have to create an appropriate compensation mechanism - and we suggest the way to create it. The corresponding project has already been prepared by Ukraine. I urge you to support it - both in Europe and at the level of the UN General Assembly., All the more so since it is in Europe that the lion's share of Russian assets is concentrated - both of the state itself, and of corrupt officials and corrupt businesses associated with the aggressor state. Russian assets should be directed to compensation for war losses., If you put your hand on your heart, each and every one of you knows perfectly well what elements should be in the formula of peace. All of you hear what the dialogue is about in Ukraine, in Europe, in the world to end this war and restore peace., Ukraine offered its way to peace. This is the European way. , The way of dialogue and principles. The way of implementation of the agreed decisions for the protection of Ukraine and humanity and constant increase of the price of the war for the aggressor. The way of bringing the perpetrators of the war to justice and compensation for damages. This is the way to victory., It is much shorter than it seems. But only on the condition that the dialogue for its sake is honest, between all those who really value freedom, and that the word ""dialogue"" does not mask the desire to turn a blind eye to war., I thank you for your attention! I thank you for your great support!, Long live Europe!, Glory to Ukraine!"
12 October 2022  - 22:49 ,"Our cooperation brings the victory of Ukraine closer - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Second Ministerial Roundtable Discussion for Support to Ukraine under the leadership of the Ukrainian Government, the World Bank Group and the IMF",", Ladies and Gentlemen,, Dear attendees,, Dear friends!, Thank you for such attention to Ukraine!, These days, our state has become the target of another blatant terrorist attack by Russia. More than a hundred Russian cruise missiles and fifty combat drones in less than two days against our civilian infrastructure and energy facilities. And that's just one attack. An attack that purposefully affected or damaged about a third of the Ukrainian energy industry., But the full-scale war against our country has been ongoing for more than 230 days, and the man who appropriated Russia is not going to end this war. He will spend tens and tens of billions of dollars more and approve many more attacks until we force Russia to make peace - with or without him., Our cooperation brings this moment closer - brings the victory of Ukraine closer., The more help Ukraine receives now, the faster the Russian war will end and the more reliably we will guarantee that such a cruel war will never spread to other countries again., I really appreciate that you all understand this! Thanks for all the support!, I am thankful to the United States of America, President Biden, Congress for their special support. 8.5 billion dollars are aimed at fulfilling our social obligations - payment of salaries, pensions, support of the social sphere of Ukraine., I am thankful to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for their leadership at the institutional level in the implementation of aid programs for Ukraine., I am thankful to the European Union and all our partners who contributed to the stabilization of Ukraine's financial situation., You all see that Ukraine is strong enough to endure this war. However, it is necessary to maintain consistency in the support of our state and develop the existing lines of aid., Each specific step in support of Ukraine is a real reduction of Russian aggression. I want to offer you three more such steps now., First, I believe that it would be useful to create a coordination format for financial support of Ukraine similar to the one created in Ramstein for defense support., Mrs. Kristalina Georgieva and I discussed the importance of donor coordination. We should create a permanent working group that would deal with the financial support of Ukraine and work efficiently at different levels - at the level of international donors and at the level of countries participating in aid., The second is to reliably cover the deficit and ensure the basics of people's lives. We see that Russian terrorist attacks may be intensified. Therefore, we must symmetrically intensify cooperation for assistance - both for the restoration of the destroyed and for guaranteeing the financial stability of our state., You know the data - this year, Russian terror led to the decline of the Ukrainian economy by more than a third. Similarly, the real income of our people decreased by a third. Thousands of enterprises and infrastructure facilities were destroyed. Millions of people became internally displaced., As of now, we have two key state financial needs. This is 38 billion dollars to cover the state budget deficit next year. These are the salaries of teachers, doctors, social benefits, and pensions. This is a guarantee of life for the Ukrainian people., Another 17 billion dollars, which are verified by the World Bank and are needed for the reconstruction of critical infrastructure within the RDNA. These are schools, hospitals, critical transport and energy infrastructure, as well as damaged housing. In fact, everything that has become a primary target for Russia., We need targeted loans of 2 billion dollars to rebuild the electricity infrastructure after the destruction and to expand exports to Europe., Also, taking into account the crisis situation created by Russia on the entire continent, we need credit limits for the purchase of gas and coal for the next heating season. The volume of this level of support is at least 5 billion dollars. We might not have to use these limits, but they should be there to ensure stability., In this context of countering the deficit and guaranteeing stability, the new program of cooperation with the International Monetary Fund is critically important. The realistic volume is up to 20 billion dollars. We must finally approve such a program as the main source of covering the deficit., And the third thing I would like to offer you today is concrete investment support tools for Ukraine. In order to activate the economy and for businesses to start investing in Ukraine now, a military risk insurance mechanism for new investment projects is needed., I hope we can launch this mechanism together with the World Bank., Another element of protection of economic activity can be the opening by partner countries of the limits of export-import agencies for the supply of equipment to Ukraine. This is what can strengthen your companies right now - in cooperation with us., Ladies and Gentlemen!, Right now, when the terrorist state is trying to intimidate us all even more, we must respond to Russian terror with even stronger and meaningful cooperation. This is real protection. Our common protection - of our common democracy, our way of life., Terror must lose. Ukraine must win. This is absolutely real - with your support., Again, I am grateful to everyone who helps!, Glory to Ukraine!"
12 October 2022  - 22:21 ,The entire Russian terror machine must and will be neutralized - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, I’ve just taken part in the work of the second ministerial roundtable discussion of donor countries, the IMF and the World Bank, which help our country maintain financial stability., The key issue is covering our budget deficit and quickly rebuilding critical infrastructure, housing and social facilities that have been destroyed or damaged by the occupiers' strikes., We are talking about significant amounts - tens of billions of dollars for the budget and the Fast Recovery. But the potential of democratic countries is much greater than the existing needs. Therefore, we are consolidating the support of partners for the sake of Ukraine. We are creating a financial ""Ramstein"" - a systemic tool for constant support of our struggle for freedom., Another meeting took place today in the format of the defense ""Ramstein"". Quite productive. First of all, they discussed providing our country with anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense systems., The more audacious and cruel Russian terror becomes, the more obvious it is to the world that helping Ukraine to protect the sky is one of the most important humanitarian tasks for Europe of our time. I believe that we will cope with this task., And I am grateful to those of our partners who have already made a decision to strengthen such support for our state - support for effective defense in the air., By the way, today I want to celebrate the fighters of our Air Forces in the southern direction. Good results were achieved there, in particular, four Russian attack helicopters and more than ten Iranian-made attack drones were shot down. We had to defend our sky today in other directions as well., We have positive news from the defense ""Ramstein"" related to the additional strengthening of our army with modern artillery. I am grateful to the partners!, Recovery after a two-day Russian missile attack continued across the country today. At that time, energy facilities were damaged in 12 regions and in the capital., As of now, the technical capability of electricity supply has been fully restored in most regions. In four regions, work is ongoing, repairs should be completed shortly., Our energy workers in some cities and districts have to use stabilization blackout schedules. This is necessary solely to maintain the normal operation of the entire energy system in such conditions - in conditions where electricity production has decreased., And I want to once again thank all our people who approached this situation consciously and make their very important contribution to guaranteeing the normal operation of Ukraine's energy system. It is worth continuing to distribute your electricity consumption by the hours of the day, in order to use as little as possible equipment that requires a significant amount of electricity during peak hours., Today I would also like to thank all the heads of regions, mayors of cities and heads of communities, who significantly reduced electricity consumption in the utilities sector. It is important!, The situation remains tough in all areas bordering the frontline. Tonight, the occupiers shelled Nikopol of the Dnipropetrovsk region with Grad and artillery. Among the wounded is a child, a girl born in 2016. An extremely serious wound..., In the morning, Russian terrorists shelled Avdiivka, Donetsk region. Central Market. The occupiers used Grad. As of now, 7 people were killed and 12 were wounded., Our intelligence, special services, law enforcement agencies are finding out all the details regarding these and other Russian strikes. No Russian terrorist will manage to remain unknown to justice - we will find out all the names and all the details., Ukraine will bring to justice every Russian murderer and torturer - from commanders to privates who carried out criminal orders. By the way, we will not forget about the propagandists of terror as well. All those who justify Russian terror and incite aggression, all those who call for murder and encourage torturing of our people will be held to account on an equal footing with murderers and torturers., The entire Russian terror machine must be neutralized. And it will be neutralized., Gratitude to everyone who brings our victory closer!, Gratitude to everyone who helps Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
11 October 2022  - 21:29 ,Restoration works are taking place quite quickly and effectively all over Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Ukrainians!, The enemy launched a second wave of terrorist attacks against our country., As of this morning, there were 28 missiles, of which 20 were shot down. More than 15 drones, almost all of them are Iranian combat drones. Most were shot down., I am thankful to all our warriors of the Air Forces, Ground Forces and Intelligence involved in defense against these Russian strikes!, And, by the way, at the request of the military command, I want to celebrate soldier Dmytro Shumskyi (anti-aircraft missile platoon of the 57th separate radio engineering battalion, Chernihiv direction) for yesterday., On October 10, Dmytro Shumskyi showed excellent skills and reaction and shot down two terrorists' cruise missiles with the help of Stinger MANPADS., One person saved dozens of lives. Thank you for that!, Restoration works are taking place quite quickly and efficiently throughout the country.,  If it wasn't for today's strikes, we would have already restored the energy supply, water supply and communications that the terrorists damaged yesterday. And today, Russia will achieve only one additional thing: it will delay our recovery a little., Where there was destruction, the infrastructure will be renewed everywhere. Where there were losses, there is already or will be construction. Where there were any hopes of the enemy, there will be ruins of Russian statehood., And I thank everyone who, at their level, provides recovery after terrorist attacks., I am grateful to the rescuers - more than a thousand employees of the State Emergency Service, who immediately arrived on calls and began neutralizing the consequences of terrorist attacks., At the suggestion of the Minister of Internal Affairs, I would like to especially note the selfless and determined actions of senior ensign Borys Shapovalov, commander of the department in the Zaporizhzhia region; sergeant Oleksandr Smiyan, firefighter-rescuer, Zaporizhzhia region; ensign Yuriy Lozynskyi and junior sergeant Oleksiy Biletskyi, respirator workers of the mining and rescue department, Kyiv city., I am grateful to all the doctors who helped the wounded and injured!, I am grateful to all energy workers and utility workers for their high-quality response and quick work., I am grateful to the local government workers, heads of local government and government officials who worked together, truly in unity and excellently., Now most of the cities and villages that the terrorists wanted to leave without electricity and communication are already with electricity and communication., In some cities and districts, work is still ongoing. In some cities and districts, energy workers apply temporary restrictions on energy supply according to the schedule - this is necessary solely in order to maintain the stability of the energy system., The government controls all this - we are trying to restore normal conditions as quickly as possible., I would also like to thank all Ukrainians who listened yesterday and limited their own electricity consumption during peak hours - from 17:00 to 22:00., Thanks to our conscientiousness, we managed to save a tenth of the energy on average in the country, which allowed the system to work more stably. And our goal should be to save a quarter of electricity precisely during these peak hours., It should be done today and in the near future., Please postpone the energy consumption of appliances that require a lot of electricity to other hours of the day. It is not difficult for an individual, and it gives a great result within the scale of our entire country., I took part today in the extraordinary summit of the Group of Seven, which was convened by the German presidency on our initiative., We discussed the response of the most powerful democracies to this new Russian escalation., For such a new wave of terror there must be a new wave of responsibility for Russia. New sanctions, new forms of political pressure and new forms of support for Ukraine., Tomorrow, the defense support for Ukraine will be discussed in the ""Ramstein"" format. I expect progress from our partners on the issue of air and anti-missile defense, agreements on new supplies of other weapons and ammunition we need., The terrorist state must be deprived of even the thought that any wave of terror can bring it anything., A separate task for intelligence is to establish all those involved in these missile attacks against Ukraine, in schemes with Iranian drones., The individual responsibility of terrorists should be the same as the responsibility of the terrorist state. We work for this., Today I had separate conversations with the Prime Minister of Italy and the Prime Minister of Australia. I heard absolutely clear support, absolutely clear condemnation of all manifestations of Russian aggression against Ukraine and international law., We also have a detailed statement from the Group of Seven, in particular, that all those responsible for terror against Ukraine will be brought to justice. Starting with the current political leadership of Russia and ending with everyone who serves these terrorist interests., Mankind and humanity are stronger than any terrorists. I am thankful to everyone who fights and works for our victory!, And one more thing. Today, 32 of our warriors were freed from Russian captivity. We do everything for Ukraine - possible and impossible. Gratitude to everyone who worked for this result!, Glory to our beautiful people! We will restore everything that was destroyed!, Glory to Ukraine!"
11 October 2022  - 20:15 ,We prepared the nomination file of Odesa for inclusion in the World Heritage List - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the 215th session of the UNESCO Executive Board,", Ladies and Gentlemen!, Dear defenders of the educational, scientific and cultural heritage of mankind!, Today, Ukraine is going through the 230th day of a full-scale war., How was your morning today? I will tell you what ours was like. At eight o'clock in the morning, most of the territory of Ukraine was already in a state of air alert., Russia launched cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea., Today, children in Ukraine didn’t go to kindergartens, schools, or universities again. Online learning is introduced everywhere., In this war, we cannot know who and what will be targeted by Russian missiles., Children or adults... An educational facility or a cultural object... A critical infrastructure facility or, for example, a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust., All of these are equal targets for Russia., This night, a Russian missile hit the premises of the Khortytsia Academy in the Zaporizhzhia region. For what? This is their tactic. The tactic of terrorists., More than 2,600 educational facilities have already been destroyed or damaged by such terrorist attacks by Russia., Yesterday in Kyiv, our capital, a Russian missile hit the crossroads in the central part of the city. People died - literally burned in cars., And it was 700 meters from the bell tower of St. Sophia’s Cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage Site., At the same crossroads are the buildings of Shevchenko University, one of the most important universities in Eastern Europe. It was affected by this strike. The Institute of Philology is damaged., Russia can award itself the special title of winner of universities, institutes, academies and schools. How many cruise missiles do educational institutions have? Zero. And Russia has hundreds of missiles., This is what its victory is like., Another Russian missile hit Tereshchenkivska Street in Kyiv yesterday. The premises of the Khanenko Museum were damaged, masterpieces by Velázquez, Canova, and Cellini are stored there. The premises of the Shevchenko Museum. One of the most renowned Kyiv publishing houses., Can you imagine a missile attack on Babyn Yar in Kyiv, the burial place of a hundred thousand victims of Nazi executions? And this strike took place., Can you imagine the shelling of the Menorah in Drobytsky Yar, Kharkiv region, where 20,000 Nazi victims are buried? And this shelling also took place., 540 is the total number of objects of cultural heritage, cultural institutions and religious buildings damaged by Russian strikes in Ukraine during the full-scale war since February 24. Almost 200 destroyed or damaged temples!, And it is possible - while I am addressing you now - that one of the Russian strikes damaged other cultural or educational objects, other memorials or temples., Ladies and Gentlemen!, Dear defenders of the educational, scientific and cultural heritage of mankind!, Please tell me why the representatives of Russia are still among you? What are they doing at UNESCO?, How can there be representatives of a terrorist state in UNESCO, which is proud of the destruction it causes in another country?, I am grateful to UNESCO for supporting Ukraine at this time and for all the principled statements that were made to protect Ukraine and culture from Russian aggression. But still, new steps are needed - steps that Russia will feel., A terrorist state definitely has no right to chair one of the key bodies for the protection of cultural and natural heritage - the UNESCO World Heritage Committee. Such a Russian presidency devalues the institution itself - its significance, its reputation., It is inadmissible to let Russia destroy the authority of UNESCO., The terrorist state must be excluded from all UNESCO bodies and from the Organization itself., Let it be a historical example for everyone in the world that no one will tolerate an enemy of culture, an enemy of history, an enemy of education, an enemy of science., Unfortunately, this is Russia's choice - to oppose everything that matters to humanity., This is its deliberate choice., The second thing that is needed now is the expansion of our joint efforts to protect cultural heritage in Ukraine. Just now! Given daily threats of Russian strikes., We must provide a clear signal that the world will not turn a blind eye to the destruction of our common history, our common culture, our common heritage., One of the steps for this should be the preservation of the historical center of Odesa - a beautiful city, an important port of the Black Sea and a source of culture for millions of people in different countries., Together with our partners, we prepared the nomination file of Odesa for inclusion in the World Heritage List. We are passing this on to UNESCO., And I am asking you to initiate an extraordinary session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee to resolve this issue for Odesa., And please, it cannot be delayed, it cannot be postponed., Odesa, like all other cities of Ukraine, is a target for Russian strikes. Please support Odesa! Show at the level of UNESCO precisely that Russian terror must end., Colleagues! Ukraine has been a conscientious member of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization since May 12, 1954. Our state always invests only in the preservation of our common heritage and never in destruction!, Now we need your support. Support in the preservation and protection of education, science and culture., I would like to express my gratitude to UNESCO and its partners for their willingness to provide 50,000 computers for Ukrainian teachers to ensure online education. But we need more., We already offer partners - both at the state level, and at the level of international and non-governmental organizations, businesses - to join the reconstruction of Ukraine after hostilities., Some partners have joined. Now I am addressing those who have not yet decided to support Ukrainian recovery. This project will definitely become the largest economic and infrastructure project in Europe over the last 50 years. And this is a historic opportunity for each of you - to be participants in this project, to be historically significant defenders of education, culture and science - our joint heritage., I believe that our common strength will be enough so that terror can never win., I thank you for your attention! Thank you for this opportunity to address you!, Glory to Ukraine!"
11 October 2022  - 17:03 ,It is necessary to intensify common efforts to create an air shield for Ukraine - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the video conference of the leaders of the Group of Seven and Ukraine,", Dear colleagues, dear friends!, Thank you Chancellor Scholz for convening this extraordinary G7 summit and thank you to all the countries that supported this initiative and to all the leaders who are here today., For the second day now, Ukraine has been suffering from massive Russian missile strikes. And for the 230th day – from the Russian terrorist war., Starting from yesterday, the enemy used more than a hundred cruise missiles and dozens of different drones, including Iranian ""Shaheds"". And every ten minutes I receive a message about the enemy's use of Iranian ""Shaheds"". As an example, here’s one hour of this morning:, 5:01 – ""Shahed” was shot down over the Black Sea., 5:11 – one more down. , 5:13 – one more., 5:28 – ""Shahed” again. , 5:30 – one more ""Shahed”. , 5:36, 5:49 – two more ""Shaheds”. , And it’s like that almost every hour! Plus 28 launches of Russian missiles today. And that's just this morning. And 84 missiles yesterday., We should all be aware that this is the enemy not only of Ukraine. It is the enemy of each of you., It is not limited to missiles. We see sabotage against gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea and against critical cables in Europe. We see an energy crisis. Food crisis and artificial threat of famine for African and Asian countries. And who does all that? Who provokes and incites that? A terrorist state. And this is Russia. Today it is so., Russia wants to provoke chaos in Ukraine and in the entire democratic world, and therefore uses everything - from missile strikes to the seizure of a nuclear plant, threats of a radiation disaster, from sabotage against infrastructure in Europe to a deliberate attempt to destroy Ukraine's energy facilities. Destroy all of them. We must stop all this., I thank you for all the help already provided. It is big, it is significant. But the Russian leader, who is now in the final stage of his reign, still has room for further escalation. This possibility of his is a threat to all of us., But we can overcome this threat. We have a formula for peace. And now, reacting to Russian terror, sham referenda and the attempt to annex our territory, we can apply the peace formula so that the terrorist state stands no chance., The first point is defense support. Air shield for Ukraine. This is part of the security guarantees that are an element of our peace formula., When Ukraine receives a sufficient number of modern and effective air defense systems, the key element of Russian terror - missile strikes - will cease to work., I thank Germany and Chancellor Scholz personally for speeding up the delivery of IRIS. I thank the USA and personally President Biden for the decision to provide modern missile defense and air defense systems. And we believe, Mr. President, that these will be medium and long-range systems that will allow us to create an echeloned defense system., I thank everyone who has already helped us secure our air defense system, which allows us to neutralize some of the Russian missiles and drones. But! According to our intelligence, Russia ordered 2,400 ""Shaheds"" alone from Iran., And that’s why, dear Mr. Chancellor, dear President of the United States, it is important that we have sufficient missiles for the air defense and anti-missile systems provided and that these systems are integrated with our defense system. Tomorrow in the format of Ramstein I would ask that our defense ministers discuss this., Mr. President of France! Mr. Prime Minister of Italy! We are very much looking forward to the delivery of the SAMP-T systems. And if possible, they are needed in the coming months., Dear friends!, Mrs. Prime Minister Truss! Prime Minister Trudeau! Prime Minister Kishida! Dear President Charles Michel! Dear Ursula von der Leyen! I am asking you to strengthen the overall effort to help financially with the creation of an air shield for Ukraine. Millions of people will be grateful to the Group of Seven for such assistance., The second point is the territorial integrity of Ukraine. It is also an element of our peace formula. And it is logically combined with the third point - with punishment, which is an integral element of any peace formula., The one who started the armed aggression is an international criminal. He must be convicted., The protection of the territorial integrity of Ukraine is the protection of the entire international legal order, starting from the UN Charter. Various potential aggressors in the world are now watching the reaction of democracies to the farce arranged by Russia with sham referenda and attempted annexation., Russia must be completely isolated and punished. Punished both politically and in terms of sanctions., I thank our European friends for the eighth sanctions package. But look - the eighth package is not a punishment for Russia. Russia has started a new stage of escalation, and therefore a new sanctions package is needed - a strong package. And I ask you to develop it!, We have to respond symmetrically at the level of the entire Group of Seven, our entire democratic world: when Russia attacks the energy sector and energy stability of our countries, we must block its energy sector with sanctions, break the stability of Russian revenues from oil and gas trade. A tough price cap is needed for the exports of oil and gas from Russia - zero profit for the terrorist state., Such steps can bring peace closer - they will encourage the terrorist state to think about peace, about the unprofitability of war., We must also recognize the obvious fact: there can be no dialogue with this leader of Russia, who has no future. He himself rejected the dialogue. Despite all our efforts to negotiate peace over the years! He speaks with ultimata, terror is his attitude to the world, to other people., After the Russian strikes, all the murders, all the abuse of civilians and international law, your societies will not understand you if you do not cut off any prospects for this leader of terror., All of us in the world should realize: talks can be either with another head of Russia - who will comply with the UN Charter, the basic principles of humanity and territorial integrity of Ukraine - or in a different configuration, so that the key terrorist does not have the opportunity to influence key decisions through terror. Now one person is blocking peace - and this person is in Moscow., Now, while we have no opportunity for diplomacy because this Russian leader only believes in terror, we need defense support. It is on the battlefield that peace is gained. But also in the sphere of diplomacy - in our work on security guarantees for Ukraine and supplementing the existing security architecture in Europe. The Kyiv Security Compact project is a real contribution to security, it is a visionary element of the peace formula for all of us. I am asking you to support this Compact!, And one more thing., Peace is possible not only when there is peace with one neighbor, but when there is peace with all neighbors. And I want to draw attention to one country. The territory of Belarus is already used for strikes against Ukraine. And now we see a bigger threat., Russia is trying to directly draw Belarus into this war, playing a provocation that we are allegedly preparing an attack on this country. Indirectly it has already involved them. And now it wants to involve them directly., Ukraine did not plan and does not plan military actions against Belarus. We are only interested in restoring our territorial integrity. But in order to completely remove this provocation, to remove these narratives by Lukashenko, to remove even the assumption of any alleged threat from us, we offer our solution., A mission of international observers may be stationed on the border of Ukraine and Belarus to monitor the security situation. The format can be worked out by our diplomats. And I ask you at the level of the Group of Seven to support this initiative of ours., Dear colleagues!, Now is the crucial time., This leader of Russia, feeling the approach of his end, is trying to force the democratic world to surrender with a terrorist rush. To retreat. To lose. This can only be the desire of an insane person - more than a hundred missile strikes in less than two days against civilians, against civilian infrastructure, sham referenda, a criminal attempt at annexation... Think about it - radiation blackmail!, The terrorist must lose. He must constantly feel that there is responsibility for terror. Let's make it happen!, I thank you for your help! I apologize for not having time to thank each country separately, each leader personally. But Ukraine knows how to be grateful, we will be grateful, we are grateful., We bring peace together!, Glory to Ukraine!"
10 October 2022  - 21:46 ,"Ukraine cannot be intimidated, we united even more instead - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Fellow Ukrainians!, Another day of our defense. A difficult day., Restoration work is currently underway across the country. We will restore all objects that were damaged by today's attack by Russian terrorists. It's only a matter of time. I tasked all structures of our state to ensure recovery as fast as possible., In some cities and regions, where there were blackouts due to shelling, the electricity supply has already been restored., As of now: Kharkiv region - 50% of energy supply has been restored. Energy crews need several hours to restore electricity supply to the majority of districts., Poltava region - restored almost everywhere. Mykolaiv region, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa region - connected. Cherkasy - connected. Khmelnytskyi - there is light in most parts of the city., In some cities and districts, efforts are still needed to give people electricity. Chernihiv region, Sumy region, Kyiv and Kyiv region, Lviv region, Ternopil region, Dnipropetrovsk region - we are working. Somewhere it takes hours, somewhere you have to wait a little longer, but the result will be everywhere., Unfortunately, 12 people died today in this terrorist attack. More than 80 were wounded or injured. Everyone who applied for help gets it., The Armed Forces of Ukraine, intelligence, the Security Service of Ukraine and all those involved in the defense of our state also perform their tasks., Of the 84 Russian missiles launched against Ukraine, 43 were shot down. Out of 24 Russian drones, 13 were shot down. And even after that, every ten minutes I get a message about the downing of Iranian ""Shaheds""., Only in the last hours..., 16:28 – ""Shahed"" was destroyed, Litky district., 17:26 – Kremenchuk, ""Shahed"" was destroyed., 17:36 – Cherkasy, ""Shahed"" was destroyed., 17:40 – Dovhyntseve, Kryvyi Rih, ""Shahed"" was destroyed., 17:50 – Apostolove, ""Shahed"" was destroyed., And it’s like that all day long. Now as I speak I continue to receive such messages. Therefore, please follow the safety rules and pay attention to the air alarm. The danger is still there. But we are fighting. , I am grateful to our Air Forces and Ground Forces units that were involved today!, The leaders of the terrorists say that they hit all the targets they planned., First, they lie, as usual., Secondly, they lie, as usual. Take a look at their real targets, apart from energy facilities. Look at just one example of our capital..., The crossroads in Kyiv where I stand. The crossroads of Volodymyrska Street and Shevchenko Boulevard. That's the target., Seven hundred meters from here is the bell tower of St. Sophia’s Cathedral. Moscow did not yet exist when it was already standing., A little further there is Volodymyr’s Hill, a place that became the source of Christianity and culture for Eastern Europe. In particular, for the territory that much later came to be called Russia., Next to me are the buildings of the Shevchenko University, which will soon celebrate its 190th anniversary. They are damaged now by this Russian strike. But we will restore everything., The Teacher's House was also damaged today. At one time, the Central Council of Ukraine worked there, and for Ukrainians this place will always be a place of memory about our glorious history of statehood., And right behind me there is a playground in Shevchenko Park, which also became a target for a Russian missile. But it is not just in Shevchenko Park. It is on one of the main museum streets of Kyiv. In particular, the Khanenko Art Museum was damaged by this attack by terrorists., And it’s like this in all the cities of our state - civil, cultural, educational facilities. Who can fight all this? Who can rejoice at strikes on such objects and such land?, They say they want to push Ukraine back into the XVIII century. But they pushed themselves back into a much older era, in the era of savages, which they became quite consciously., And Ukraine will still remain in the XXI century., Kyiv saw various strangers. And survived them all. Kyiv will also survive this onslaught of terrorists who have no history, no tradition, no culture. They are temporary. And even if they live for 70 years, they still don't have enough time to understand anything., Ukraine cannot be intimidated. We united even more instead. Ukraine cannot be stopped. We are convinced even more that terrorists must be neutralized. , The Russian army carried out these strikes during the morning rush hour on purpose. This is a typical terrorist tactic. They wanted to incite more fear and affect more people. They affected. They affected the whole world., Today I have already spoken with the Chancellor of Germany, the President of France, the Emir of Qatar, the President of Poland, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Secretary-General of the United Nations., I had a meeting with the U.S. Ambassador. Now I have conversations scheduled with the Prime Minister of Canada and the President of the United States. Tomorrow - with the Prime Minister of Italy., I am grateful to all for the unambiguous support!, We’re consolidating the world. And I feel that the world is with us. An extraordinary meeting of the G7 is already scheduled for tomorrow. We are working on a resolution for the UN General Assembly to condemn Russia for all its escalating steps, for its terror. Terror inevitably receives a global response. And the blatant nature of Russian terror only encourages everyone to be more determined., Regarding energy. We will do everything to restore normal production and supply of electricity. We need electricity to be supplied for all families, regardless of any manifestations of Russian terror. We need energy to be supplied to all our homes, in all regions., Therefore, we need a reasonable consumption of electricity now. There are hours of peak load on the power system - from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. I am asking you, please, at this time, consume electricity in such a way as not to overload the power system. Please postpone washing, ironing, repairing and using other electrical appliances that consume a lot of energy before 5 p.m. or after 10 p.m. A strong request., The more Ukrainians consume electricity in this way, the more stable our energy system will be., We are doing everything to get modern air defense systems. And I am grateful to the partners who are already speeding up the delivery., We are doing everything to strengthen our Armed Forces. And now the occupiers already cannot oppose us on the battlefield, that is why they resort to this terror. Well, we’ll make the battlefield even more excruciating for the enemy. And we will restore everything that was destroyed., Please help each other! Please take care of those who are left alone in such circumstances! Believe in yourself, in Ukraine, in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and in our victory! , Glory to Ukraine!"
10 October 2022  - 11:09 ,"We are Ukrainians, we help each other, we believe in ourselves, we restore the destroyed - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Ukrainians!, The morning is tough. We are dealing with terrorists., Dozens of missiles, Iranian ""Shaheds"". They have two targets., Energy facilities throughout the country. Kyiv region and Khmelnytskyi region, Lviv and Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Ivano-Frankivsk region, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy region, Kharkiv region, Zhytomyr region, Kirovohrad region, the south of the country., They want panic and chaos, they want to destroy our energy system. They are incorrigible., The second target is people., Such a time and such goals were specially chosen to cause as much damage as possible., But. We are Ukrainians. We help each other. We believe in ourselves. We restore everything destroyed., There may be temporary power outages now, but there will never be an outage of our confidence - our confidence in victory., Why such strikes exactly? The enemy wants us to be afraid, wants to make people run. But we can only run forward - and we demonstrate this on the battlefield. It will continue to be so., Rescuers are working now. Our air defense system is working. 38 aerial targets have already been shot down., Please stay in shelters today. Thanks to the help of our military, everything will be fine., Always follow the safety rules. And always remember: Ukraine existed before this enemy appeared, and Ukraine will exist after it., Glory to Ukraine!"
9 October 2022  - 22:14 ,The constant terror against the civilian population is an obvious Russian refusal to engage in real negotiations - address by the President of Ukraine,", Today I want to address those in the world who give in to Russian manipulations about the alleged negotiations. About an assumption that it is supposedly only negotiations that can end this brutal Russian terrorist war., Does the terrorist state want peace? Obviously not. It proves that every day and every night., Zaporizhzhia. One of the Ukrainian cities against which Russia directs its missile terror., At least 14 people died last night as a result of Russian strikes on ordinary residential buildings in Zaporizhzhia. Unfortunately, this number may increase. Debris is still being cleared. More than 70 people were injured, including 11 children. All of them are provided with proper aid., Hundreds of families were left homeless. An entire block, from the first to the sixth floor, was destroyed by one of the missiles - a heavy anti-ship missile Kh-22 - aimed at an ordinary nine-story residential building., It was a deliberate strike. The one who gave the order and those who carried it out knew what they were targeting., The strikes this night continued a series of Russian missile strikes on Zaporizhzhia, which have killed at least 43 people since October 3 this week alone. And there were also strikes on Kharkiv, on the cities of Donbas, on other cities of Ukraine... There were also strikes by Iranian drones. Airstrikes. The absolute majority of them were aimed at the civil infrastructure of Ukraine and civilians., When someone wants to negotiate, he does not do so. And when someone is a terrorist, that’s exactly what he does., Do negotiations really help overcome terror? Now everyone has to answer this question honestly. Terrorists are neutralized., Terrorism is a crime that must be punished. Terrorism at the state level is one of the most heinous international crimes, which threatens not just someone in the world, but the entire international community., If terror goes unpunished, if the terrorist succeeds in intimidation so much that someone in the world is willing to simply turn a blind eye to terror, then that will be a loss - a loss of freedom, a loss of humanity and a loss of democracy. This is exactly what Russia longs for. This is why it needs all this terror - from missile strikes to global crises provoked by a terrorist state., This has already happened in history. Last time another terrorist state was allowed to do what it wanted because the world powers were afraid of its terror, World War II started., Now the world is united. Now everyone in the world understands what this war in Ukraine is actually being waged against by Russia. This is a Russian war against all those values that make people human and life peaceful., Ukraine will win this war. We can liberate our entire land and we can put the terrorist state in place. Russia must be punished for terror. Only this guarantees that the confrontation will not grow to an even greater scale and will not spread to other countries., But for this we must preserve the maximum unity - the unity of all the people of the world who value peace, respect the right to life for everyone and are honest enough to admit: the constant terror against the civilian population is an obvious Russian refusal to engage in real negotiations., Therefore, official designation of Russia as a terrorist state is needed - designation at all levels., It is necessary to limit any economic contacts with any Russian subjects - you cannot be a sponsor of terrorism., We need a clear condemnation at all levels of every escalating step by Russia - from terrorist attacks to the criminal attempt to annex our territory. The relevant resolution will be considered by the UN General Assembly in a few days. We will see from the vote who and how treat terrorists in reality., And Ukraine needs principled and sufficient aid. Aid to our people who are targeted by the terrorist state. It is necessary to accelerate the provision of a sufficient number of effective air defense systems to Ukraine. The negotiations on the provision of such air defense systems, the negotiations on increasing other defense, political and financial support for Ukraine are the only possible negotiation format that can really bring peace closer., I am grateful to everyone who helps us resist terror! , I am grateful to everyone who fights and works for the return of peace to Ukraine and guarantees of the right to life and security to every Ukrainian., Eternal memory to all victims of Russian terror!, Glory to Ukraine!"
8 October 2022  - 21:25 ,"If occupiers flee, this will be the best option for them – address of President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians!, Today was a good and mostly sunny day on the territory of our state. It was about 20 degrees and sunny in large parts of the country., Unfortunately, it was cloudy in Crimea. Although it is also warm. But no matter what the clouds are, Ukrainians know what to do. And they know that our future is sunny., This is a future without occupiers. Throughout our territory, in particular in Crimea., If the occupiers flee while they have a chance, this will be the best option for them. If they are forced to stay, any occupier can find a way to surrender to Ukrainian captivity., We guarantee the preservation of lives to all Russian military servicemen who voluntarily lay down their arms and surrender.
 Ukraine always adheres to all international norms and conventions., We will not leave any other options for the occupiers to rely on., And again and again I want to thank all our citizens who are fighting and working for peace for Ukraine, for the liberation of our entire land., This day, the movement of our military, the Security Service of Ukraine, the National Guard and all those who take part in active actions – actions in the east, actions in the south of our country – continued., We are holding positions in Donbas, in particular in the Bakhmut direction, where now it is very, very hard, very tough fighting. Today, I would like to once again mention our soldiers from the Kholodny Yar 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade for their courage and sustained power in this direction., Thanks to all our anti-aircraft gunners and everyone involved in the air defense of Ukraine., We are doing everything we can to defend Ukrainian skies, and it is one of the highest priorities for our diplomats to speed up the decision of our partners to provide Ukraine with modern and effective anti-aircraft systems in sufficient quantity., We will definitely come to that., In the de-occupied territories, we do not slow down the pace of reconstruction work for a single day. It's transport, it's electricity, it's gas supply, it's postal services, social benefits – wherever there is a real possibility to provide it, we provide it., I must ask all Ukrainians in the territory where the occupiers were to be especially attentive to the mine threat., Our explosive ordnance disposal teams, our bomb disposal engineers are working at their maximum, but after the occupiers, a very large area is contaminated with mines. Please do not ignore mine warnings, do not visit areas closed due to danger, please report any mines or unexploded ordnance found to the police, emergency services or local authorities., And I want to add one more thing., Lawyer's Day is celebrated in Ukraine today. Not everyone who has a law degree works in law. But among those who still work in this field, there are people whose contribution is truly historic. Very important., Those who investigate into the crimes of the occupiers. Those who help to restore justice, in particular by working in the field of human rights. Those who do everything so that every Russian murderer and the aggressor state itself are inevitably punished for this war. I thank all of you for this very important work!, I'm thankful to investigators, prosecutors, human rights defenders, lawyers, civil servants, and employees of public organizations.
 I'm thankful to everyone who teaches law, fights for the rule of law and helps people defend their rights, freedoms and legitimate interests., Justice for Ukraine, for Europe, for the world must and will be restored. Thanks to our indomitable, strong, conscientious and educated people., Eternal glory to all who defend Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
8 October 2022  - 15:27 ,"We must strengthen our alliances and cooperation, we must get rid of all types of dependence on Russia - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the 2BS FORUM in Montenegro",", Dear friends!, Mr. Presidents!, Thank you for this opportunity to address the members and guests of your security forum., Security is a key issue of our time. And, without exaggeration, everything depends on what answer we offer now., Not only our state institutions, our sovereignty, borders, and political system depend on it. It is literally about life. About peace for all of us., For the first time in many decades, we found ourselves in such conditions when we have to defend the right to life for our nations. Not just one or another living conditions, not just one or another concept for life in Europe or in certain regions, but life itself., Russia's war against Ukraine is only a harbinger of what can await any state on our continent or in other parts of the world that this aggressor can reach., And I am grateful to everyone who understands the meaning of Russian aggression and helps us - us as ourselves., So, analyzing the elements of the Russian war against our state and the specific steps of the aggressor, we can draw conclusions about what forms and methods of protection we need for the sake of security., The first is unity. This is the foundation. This is something that should always be not only formally, but also in essence. Not only at summits, but also in deeds. Not only with those with whom you are used to cooperating, but with everyone whose values are common and whose way of life is freedom., Russia is afraid of our unity. So it goes to great lengths to break it., But we are only strengthening our unity. And therefore, we cannot be conquered by Russia. Neither Ukraine, nor Montenegro, nor any other state of the free world., Where real unity is achieved, there will be peace. Just as it will be in Ukraine., The second is democracy. This is our character. We can see that the current leaders of Russia have an obsessive desire to break the principle of democratic change of power in all countries regarding which they have aggressive ambitions., They do not recognize the results of elections and people’s movements when they lose influence because of them. And they try to stage coups or corrupt the political process when they choose a puppet to represent their interests. We have to strictly oppose this., All European states must dismantle any Russian networks of influence. So that there is no spread of misinformation, corruption and criminal politics. It is no less important for the Balkans than for our part of Europe., The third is independence. We should recognize the obvious at all levels in Europe and the world: Russia is not a threat to one, but to everyone. Therefore, everyone must achieve complete independence from Russia, so that it cannot turn dependence on it into shackles: economic dependence, energy dependence, political dependence - any., The fourth is weapons. It sounds a little unusual in Europe, but now we see what kind of war Russia can make literally out of nothing.
 Russia can block the sea for a country it wants to capture. It can burn cities and villages. It can arrange missile terror., Look at the intensity of the war we are now waging for our defense. Take a look - and you will be able to estimate the amount of weapons that may be needed for defense in such a war, if Russia turns the territory of another country into a battlefield., No matter how difficult it may be, we must ensure for Ukraine now, so that we can restore peace to all its citizens, and for Europe after this war such a volume of weapons, such a power of weapons, that Russia will never again have the desire to destroy peace., And the fifth point is responsibility. For many years, the head of Russia and his entourage have felt complete impunity., They destroyed democracy in their country. And they began to destroy everything around Russia. They are used to stealing what they like and buying those who were supposed to protect the national interests of this or that state from them., They started a war against Ukraine in 2014 because they felt that they would not be punished for it. The war against Georgia showed them this., They carried out a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, because they do not believe that the world will be able to hold them accountable not just for the crime of aggression against a sovereign state, but for any crime imaginable., So to bring them to justice is to guarantee long-term peace after this war. The inevitability of punishment is one of the key principles of criminal justice. And we must apply this principle to the Russian leadership as they deserve it., Ladies and Gentlemen!, Dear friends!, We must strengthen our alliances and cooperation. We must get rid of all kinds of dependence on Russia., We must ensure that we have sufficient weapons and effectiveness to provide full protection in the air, on land, at sea, and in cyberspace – in this war that Russia is already waging against Ukraine, and in any new war if Russia wants to expand hostilities now or to repeat the aggression in the future., By the way, all this is taken into account in our proposals for updating the security architecture of Ukraine and Europe, which we presented. And I ask all of you to familiarize yourself with the draft Kyiv Security Compact, which can become a fundamental prerequisite for peace in Eastern Europe., And, finally, punishment for aggression., Sanctions against Russia are mandatory. They should not just act, but regularly be intensified so that the aggressor state does not have time to adapt. I am grateful to everyone who supports such a policy!, And I am grateful to everyone who works together with us to ensure that every Russian murderer and torturer receives a legal punishment.
 I have no doubts about the victory of Ukraine. We can restore peace and freedom to the entire Ukrainian territory. The successes of our warriors on the frontline prove this., But I want to be able to say that I do not doubt the complete security of Europe and each of our nations after this war. This is also possible. We know the right answers to the key question of our time, and therefore there will be peace., I thank you for your attention!, Thank you for your support!, Glory to Ukraine!

7 October 2022  - 21:26 ,We must de-occupy all lands that Russia is trying to keep for itself – address of President of Ukraine,", Dear Ukrainians!, An important decision was made today. It's fair. Legally perfect. Historical., Ukraine confirmed its respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Japan, including its Northern territories, which are still under Russian occupation., Today, I signed the relevant decree. There is a corresponding statement of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. And we call on everyone in the world to make similar decisions., Russia has no right to these territories. Everyone in the world knows this well. And we must finally act., We must de-occupy all the lands that the Russian occupiers are trying to keep for themselves., Only in this way can we return the full force to international law. The UN Charter and the entire complex of treaties and conventions on which the international legal order is based will work only when the occupiers lose and the nations in the world are protected from any occupations., With this war against Ukraine, against the international legal order, against our people, Russia has put itself in conditions – and it is now only a matter of time – of the real liberation of everything that once was seized and is now under the control of the Kremlin., Russia, by its example, will show all potential aggressors of the world that an aggressive terrorist war in our time is a way to weaken and inevitably destroy the one who starts such a war., The aggressor must lose. So be it. So that such wars do not happen again and that the peace is really long-term. Nothing should be left for the invaders., I believe: justice will be restored for our partners as well., This week alone, our soldiers liberated 776 square kilometers of territory in the east of our country and 29 settlements, including six in Luhansk region, from the Russian pseudo-referendum. In total, 2,434 square kilometers of our land and 96 settlements have already been liberated since the beginning of this offensive operation., And today I want to mention the fighters of the 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, the 80th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade and the 25th Separate Airborne Brigade and note their heroic efforts to liberate Ukrainian land., There are also good results in the south of Ukraine this week – we are liberating our land and our people there from the pseudo-referendum every day., We will certainly come to the lands that were occupied by Russia earlier., I'm thankful to all our defenders who ensure this!, During these 225 days, 29,887 Ukrainian soldiers were awarded state awards. A total of 178 soldiers were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine., Such a scale of courage and heroism of our fighters unequivocally proves that Ukraine cannot be stopped., And each of the Russian attacks, all manifestations of Russian terror – against Zaporizhzhia, against Kharkiv, against Mykolaiv, against Donbas and all our other territories – only prove that the liberation of our entire land is the only foundation of peace and security for all Ukrainians., Today, I took part in the meeting of the European Council. I thanked our partners for the eighth package of sanctions against Russia and for all the support for Ukraine that is already provided., We are working together to increase our common capabilities – of everyone in Europe., Preparations have already begun for important events planned for next week, both in Ukraine and at the international level., It will be a strong week for our state, it will be a strong week for our defense., Eternal glory to all those who fight and work for peace for Ukraine!, Eternal glory to our heroes!, Glory to Ukraine!"
7 October 2022  - 14:44 ,We must never stop defending freedom and democracy - speech of the President of Ukraine at the European Council meeting,", Dear friends! Dear colleagues!, First of all, I want to thank you, Charles, and I also want to thank the Czech Presidency for this opportunity and Prime Minister Fiala personally for the invitation to participate in this event. Ukraine – as it should be – together with all Europeans., This is a familiar thing for everyone now – and at our level, when we regularly meet and work together in various European formats. Also it is familiar for people in our countries – because for most Europeans, Ukraine is an integral part of the European space., The space of freedom, democracy, social development and fundamental values that unite us all., It makes Europe so attractive to many people from other parts of the world., But let's look back for a moment – to the very recent past. Just a few generations before us the European space that we have today could have been nothing more than a dream., And such a bold dream that it was very difficult to believe that it could be realized., Europe was a continent of discord, warlike ambitions, clannishness, lack of freedom, inequality, and poverty. And Europeans had to flee to other parts of the world just to survive and develop their potential., So it was. Europe has done a lot to overcome this., And even Russia will not be able to push our common continent into such a past. Although Russia openly seeks this, it spends a lot of energy, a lot of money, resources on it, fights for this and provokes anti-European crises, the impact of which is felt by everyone in Europe – from Portugal to Finland., But what gives confidence that the European path is irreversible?, There is only one answer – unity. And it is the unity of not only leaders and states. Not only in the legal space. Not only in our institutions – EU institutions and others, it is not only in their work., It is very important that the unity of our perception of Europe as a task remains., Yesterday, Mr. Fiala, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, while addressing the European leaders gathered in Prague for the inaugural meeting of the new format of cooperation on our continent, recalled this image that was proposed by Václav Havel., Europe as a task., Today, at the meeting of the European Council, I would like to emphasize once again exactly this image. Because this is the source of our strength., Europe will remain exactly as it is now, as long as Europeans perceive what they have, how they live, what they received from previous generations, not as a givenness, but as a task., Peace in Europe is not a state, but a task., Our values, their popularity and strength are not a givenness, but a task., And democracy is not something that can always be, because it already exists now, it is also the task., Social development, the pursuit of equality in diversity, which distinguishes Europe from other parts of the world, is also not something that we can simply get from our parents or simply pass on to our children, it is the task., And security... Security is also not a state, not a givenness, not an inheritance that can be received or transferred, but the task., It is a constantly renewing task that can never be abandoned and that constantly needs new thoughts, steps and solutions to preserve all that you and I value so much and that is so familiar to us., And especially now – at a time when Europe is being so brutally attacked at many levels by the most anti-European state of the modern world – Russia., Russia brought war to our land – to the Ukrainian part of Europe. And only thanks to the fact that the Ukrainian people stopped this invasion of Russia, Russia cannot yet bring the same war to other parts of Europe, in particular, the Baltic countries, Poland, and Moldova., The whole of Europe is placed in the conditions of a severe price crisis, when through the manipulation of the energy market Russia achieves unprecedented pressure on the standard of living of the absolute majority of Europeans., And all of us are on the brink of a nuclear disaster due to the capture of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant by Russian troops., These are terrible conditions. But we are all together, we defend ourselves vigorously, we have not abandoned our task., We have established and should only increase our cooperation in the security and defense areas., Increase the supply of weapons and ammunition to defend against the Russian pressure., Increase the manufacture of weapons and ammunition in Europe to be always ready to defend our common space., Indeed, I understand, and all of us would rather spend the money we spend on armaments on completely different goals – peaceful goals, social needs. But who and what will be able to protect such goals and such needs?, We have to be especially careful about the protection of our critical infrastructure – and especially after the sabotage that happened at gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea., Never before has our continent faced such a threat – the threat of destroying underwater pipelines, cables, and tunnels. But now you can expect this from Russia., At the same time, we must strengthen our cooperation to help each other, provide all Europeans with adequate energy guarantees. Russia must not succeed in its effort to force Europeans into energy poverty or even a complete lack of energy., The key challenge is in Ukraine., The first is the physical protection of energy facilities from Russian strikes. We need enough air defense systems to prevent Russia from leaving people without heat and electricity in the winter., The second is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. We must finally force Russia to immediately comply with the demands of the IAEA and all normal people of the world and demilitarize the plant. And this is not only about Russian military equipment, but also about the removal of all troops from the plants. Right now there are 500 Russian terrorists at the Zaporizhzhia plant. And there is no place for them there!, This is essential for nuclear safety. This is absolutely essential for Ukraine to have the necessary volume of electricity for export. For export, which is fundamentally important for our neighbors in the EU this winter., The third is reconstruction. Fast restoration of facilities destroyed by Russia during hostilities., I am grateful to those countries that have already started working under our Fast Recovery Plan. And we expect a substantive discussion on this during the Conference in Germany on October 25., We have already created and must constantly strengthen the system of sanction pressure on the aggressor., I thank you very much for the adoption of the eighth package of EU sanctions, which includes, in particular, Russian oil. We must continue moving in this direction – the direction of pressure on the Russian energy sector, on this main source of income of the aggressor state., And we must maintain political leadership. This is especially important right now – when Russian forces have finally arrived on the battlefield, and our heroes are liberating Ukrainian land every day – village after village, city after city., To stop the liberation of Ukraine, Russia began to manipulate the topic of negotiations, and allegedly mentioned the dialogue, which it rejected, starting this war against Ukraine and against all of you, against all of Europe., It is obvious that Russia does not want any real negotiations. Because if it wanted to, it would have responded to dozens of our proposals and efforts. Russia just wants to save time. Wants to regroup forces. And accumulate resources. To strike again. We have to stop it from doing that., Like everything else in Europe, security is not something you can get by giving up something or signing a treaty. Security is a task. The task of expelling the occupier from the territory occupied by it. The task of holding murderers and executioners to account. The task of restoring the validity of the fundamental standards and conventions approved by the international community for all states without exception., We must be strong – until our common victory to preserve all that we value so much. We must never stop defending freedom and democracy so that our children and grandchildren can enjoy at least the same amount of rights and freedoms that we have., And we must invest now in our defense, in our security, in our cooperation as much as possible, so that anyone in the world, who might even have a thought to start an anti-European path, will forever be aware that the strength of European unity is insuperable., I thank you for your attention! I thank you for your support!, Long live united Europe! United also as a task. A task for us and you. Equal leaders of European countries – countries of the European Union. All de facto, but not all de jure yet. And this is also a task for you and me – a task for the sake of our Europe. The space of freedom, democracy, social development and fundamental values that unite us all., Thank you! Thank you, Charles!, Glory to Ukraine!"
6 October 2022  - 22:27 ,"Since the beginning of October, more than half a thousand square kilometers have been liberated from the Russian occupiers in the Kherson region alone - address by the President of Ukraine",", Ukrainians!, Today is the day of active diplomacy. We inform our partners about the latest manifestations of Russian terror. About missile strikes on Zaporizhzhia and other cities of Ukraine. About the use of Iranian drones against our people and infrastructure., For some reason, Iran claims that there are no Iranian-made drones in Ukraine. People see them in the sky. We shoot them down. But we are told that there are allegedly no Iranian drones in Ukraine. Well, we’ll find ways to ensure that there aren't any left indeed., We also provide information about our movement on the frontline. Since October 1, more than half a thousand square kilometers of territory and dozens of settlements have been liberated from the Russian sham referendum and stabilized only in the Kherson region., There are also successes in the eastern direction. The day will surely come when we will report on successes in the Zaporizhzhia region as well - in those areas that are still under the control of the occupiers. The day will come when we will also talk about the liberation of Crimea., This perspective is obvious. It is also obvious that there is still some way to go. There is still a lot to endure, a lot to do. Both for Ukrainians and for our partners - all who value freedom and international law., I’ve talked today with representatives of political, business and expert circles of Australia. I felt full support and interest in our victory. By the way, Australia is among the top 10 countries that provide us with defense aid. This is a very significant contribution to the protection of our state, the international legal order and humanity as such., I’ve addressed the European leaders at the summit of the European Political Community held today in Prague. I called on them to do everything so that this new format of our cooperation in Europe, which unites different states: from Iceland to Azerbaijan, from Spain to Turkey, could become not just a gathering of politicians, but a gathering of peacemakers. Europe needs a community of those who know how to protect peace and put any terrorists in their place., These days, the European Union is moving towards the introduction of the eighth package of sanctions against Russia. In particular, this package envisages limiting the sea transportation of Russian oil and creates a toolkit to limit the oil revenues of the terrorist state. This is good. But this is only the beginning., We must ensure that the terrorist state does not receive any profit from the sale of oil and gas. So that not a single oil dollar and not a single gas euro could go to the continuation of the Russian war against Ukraine and the entire civilized world. I am confident that it will be ensured in due time., And I thank all Europeans, all in the free world, who work for this result. Who promote the necessary political decisions and who create the necessary economic alternatives to Russian energy resources., I will continue working in this direction tomorrow. I will address the participants of the meeting of the European Council., Today in Kyiv I met with Samantha Power, head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID). We discussed the existing and prospective programs of our cooperation, the implementation of our plan for the rapid reconstruction of Ukraine. The main focus of these programs is security. And we will soon introduce this new security approach to our civil infrastructure to the public., I thanked Mrs. Power for allocating funds to prepare our infrastructure for the winter period, in particular heating., I held a meeting today with IAEA Head Grossi, who arrived in Kyiv. It is clear that our negotiations primarily concerned the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant captured by Russian terrorists. But in fact, this topic is much broader. It concerns not only Ukraine and not only in the context of radiation safety., Of course, any decisions of the current head of Russia regarding the Zaporizhzhia station and any attempts by Russia to transfer the station to its alleged ownership are worthless and, frankly speaking, stupid. This is a nuclear power plant. This is not some palace, Yukos or something else that the Russian leadership has already managed to steal., Only Ukrainian specialists can guarantee that there will be no radiation incidents at the Zaporizhzhia station. And it was important to hear from Mr. Grossi that the international community will only contact Ukraine regarding the ZNPP, because it is Ukrainian property. Was, is and will be., Now there are about five hundred occupiers at the station. And this is nothing but five hundred risks of disaster. The world understands this. And I am grateful for the support of everyone who is fighting for the return of full Ukrainian control over the station and for its complete demilitarization., Another aspect of this topic is electricity itself. And if the Zaporizhzhia station is not working, we in Ukraine face certain difficulties. We are getting a situation where we do not have a surplus of electricity, which we can, in particular, export to EU countries., This is a disadvantage for the people of the EU, who lose a reliable source of energy supply. This is a disadvantage for us, Ukrainians. We are honest about it. We say honestly that all of us in Europe must fight for our interests together - in complete unity., I thank everyone who helps Ukraine!, I thank everyone who fights and works for our victory!, Glory to Ukraine!"
6 October 2022  - 17:05 ,Russian evil will lose when our peace formula prevails - speech by the President of Ukraine at the meeting of the leaders of the European Political Community,", Ladies and Gentlemen!, Dear hosts of our meeting and inspirators of the idea of our meeting!, Dear Prime Minister Fiala!, Dear President Michel!, Dear Mr. President Macron!, Dear leaders of Europe!, At this first meeting of ours in this format, I would like to congratulate you on the establishment of our new political initiative., I would like to congratulate you on the fact that, thanks to this initiative, we have received not just another format of cooperation in Europe, but an extremely powerful opportunity to restore peace in Europe., This gathering, the European Political Community, has a real possibility of becoming a European Community of Peace., Peace! That Ukraine needs so much. That absolutely every country presented here today needs., Currently, representatives of all existing formats of cooperation in Europe based on our common values are participating in this meeting., Here with us are those who joined the EU and those who are preparing to join., Here with us are those who are part of NATO, and those who are building cooperation with the Alliance as candidate countries or partners of NATO., Here with us are representatives of various regional associations of Europeans., And there are no representatives of Russia with us here - a state that geographically seems to belong to Europe, but from the point of view of its values and behavior is the most anti-European state in the world., We are now in a strong position to direct all possible powers of Europe to end the war and guarantee long-term peace - for Ukraine, for Europe, for the world., Ukraine never wanted this war. Ukraine did nothing to provoke it. Ukraine has always been a leader in peaceful settlement., And all of you are well informed about how much Ukraine has done to try to convince Russia to live without war., Many of you personally participated in these efforts and helped us., Helped us in almost a hundred rounds of negotiations of various levels, at which peace was offered to Russia. I thank each and every one of you for this effort., But we must admit the obvious: we are forced to deal with a state that does not want peace. Which responds to all proposals for real peace with missile strikes, provocation of artificial crises and ridicule., Russia subordinated its entire policy to only one task, namely, waging war. War against Ukraine, against Europe, against the world., Ladies and Gentlemen! Colleagues!, Peace is needed! Russia kills. It kills on the battlefield in Ukraine, in our peaceful cities... And on the streets of your cities., Russian killers made attempts on people in various European countries. And organized sabotage in Europe - against warehouses with weapons, against factories, and now against gas pipelines., Russia intimidates and blackmails for the world to stop helping those it kills. It uses everything from the food crisis to radiation blackmail, from destabilizing energy markets to nuclear blackmail. All in order to break the unity of allies and partners, to intimidate nations, to make millions of people afraid and on the basis of this fear - to give in., Give up values, first of all. Our common values of freedom, democracy and the right of nations to live freely., Russia is trying to fix every danger and every manifestation of instability that it has already created. This is exactly what it calls negotiations, this is exactly how it perceives any agreements., Russia wants to redraw the borders - to once again divide the world into zones of influence, destroying our common space of cooperation and development., Russia corrupts. It corrupts with the billions it earns from trading in energy resources., This is the Russian formula for war: kill, intimidate, fix threats to free states and their losses, destroy borders and corrupt., And each of these elements is anti-European. All of them are directed against Europe., Ukraine is only the first battlefield this state has entered. And it is in Ukraine that it is necessary to defeat it., We must implement our peace formula. I presented it in my speech at the UN General Assembly. It must be fully implemented., The items of our peace formula neutralize everything that Russia does to fight., The first is to punish the aggressor. Increase sanctions against Russia. Stop any cooperation with Russia and its companies. Exclude it from all international organizations or at least suspend its membership, its ability to distort the activities of international institutions - first of all, the UN., Russia is making the United Nations a gathering of 192 who are simply forced to put up with one state lying and mocking and vetoing when it wants to block the UN's real ability to restore peace., Of course, in order to punish the aggressor, we need a Special Tribunal for the crime of aggression by Russia against Ukraine and an international compensation mechanism that will force Russia to compensate for the damages they caused., The second is aid to Ukraine. By helping us, each of your states is helping itself., Look at the battlefield in Ukraine now - it is such an intense war that the absolute majority of states simply would not be able to wage it. And that is why this war must be won now - in Ukraine., So that the Russian fleet cannot block other ports in the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea or any other sea. So that Russian tanks do not advance on Warsaw or again on Prague. So that Russian artillery does not fire at the Baltic states. So that Russian missiles do not hit the territory of Finland or any other country., Such a threat exists. We reduce such a threat every day when we destroy the occupiers in Ukraine., The third point of our peace formula is the restoration of security and territorial integrity., We do it. We do it together with you. With your help., The fourth point is security guarantees. We need security guarantees before we join NATO. And on this path. And we will do it. We will also do it together with you. Our proposals for security guarantees are presented to partners., The fifth is determination., In 225 days of full-scale war, we have all already shown that Europe can influence the issues of war and peace. But now - all together - we must ensure that the formula for war is completely blocked and the formula for peace is fully implemented., Today, Russia launched another airstrike on Ukrainian cities., It used Iranian drones again. By the way, they are used every day, and so far Iran says every day that there are allegedly no such drones here., And again hit with rockets., Unfortunately, there are victims again - dead and wounded people, burnt houses., In Zaporizhzhia, after the first missile strike today, when people came to clear the debris, Russia launched a second missile strike..., Absolute meanness. Absolute evil. There have already been thousands of manifestations of such evil. Unfortunately, there may be thousands more., But the day will come when Russian evil will lose., This will be the very day when our peace formula will prevail. When we will fully use all the possibilities of our unity., Here and now, I urge you to make a basic decision. A decision about purpose for this community of ours. For this format of ours., We, the leaders of Europe, can become the leaders of peace. Our European political community can become a European community of peace., So, let's do it! And let today be the starting point. The point from which Europe and the entire free world will move to guaranteed peace for all of us. It is possible., Thank you for your attention!, Thank you all for your support!, Glory to Ukraine!"
6 October 2022  - 13:42 ,The world must show the strength needed to put an end to the aggressor's ability to escalate - President during a speech in the Australian Lowy Institute,", Thank you very much, dear Mr. Lowy! Dear Mr. Fullilove!, Ladies and Gentlemen!, Thank you for this opportunity to address you today and answer the most pressing questions of our time. A time that has such a strong connection with the past., Almost 8 years ago, in November 2014, here in Sydney, at the Lowy Institute, you had a speech by Angela Merkel, then Federal Chancellor of Germany., She in particular touched upon the topic of the Russian war against Ukraine - the criminal annexation of our Crimea, hostilities in Donbas and destruction of the Malaysian Boeing in the sky over Ukraine. Mrs. Merkel then noted that ""the Ukrainian crisis is really more than a regional crisis, it affects all of us."", Let me remind you once again - these words were said almost 8 years ago, i.e. 8 years before Russia was able to turn a hybrid war against Ukraine - a war, not a crisis after all - into a full-scale invasion, the likes of which Europe has not seen since World War II., Why was this possible? Why, despite the understanding already in 2014 that Russian aggression is not something local, but really a global threat, Russia still had the possibility of such an escalation, which began on February 24 of this year?, This question reveals the connection between our time with even more ancient history., With a history that still hasn't really become history. It is still with us - in the present., On September 30 of this year, the head of Russia announced the purported annexation of part of the territory of Ukraine. Four of our regions, from which the Russian occupation contingent has not yet been ousted., This new attempt by Russia to grab someone else's property is an obvious attempt to repeat 2014 - to repeat Crimea. And not just annexation as such., Russia is trying to put the international community in such conditions now that the reaction to yet another Russian crime against international law does not correspond to its severity in the same way as it did then - with Crimea., In 2014, we did not see, for example, really tough sanctions against Russia. It was not punished for this crime. At that time, there was a very strong desire among many in the world to turn a blind eye to the annexation, to consider the war simply a ""crisis"" and to continue relations with Russia., Although they said then that the threat was global, they acted as if it was something purely local…, And to say that this increased the aggressor's sense of impunity is an understatement., But this always happens: when a criminal does not receive an adequate punishment for a crime he has committed, he perceives it as permission for further criminal acts. ""They are weak,"" is how the aggressor reacts when he feels no response., Will he feel it now?, Knowingly or not, the Russian leader chose a very symbolic date to start this attempt to annex our territory. September 30. This day takes us back 84 years in the history of Europe and the world., It was on this day that another aggressor – yet so similar to this one – succeeded in signing the Munich Agreement. Also to annex someone else's land., Now we remember that agreement more often under the name of the ""Munich conspiracy"" and consider it an example of political cynicism and a fatal mistake. A mistake that cost humanity tens of millions of lives., But after the signing of ""Munich"", such evaluations sounded different. They even said that the agreement would give peace to the generation at that time..., In different countries and with different voices, the thesis that it is possible to simply agree that the aggressor has seized something is heard again. That it is possible to draw some kind of conditional line somewhere that will satisfy Russia's appetite, and supposedly after that the war will die down. And that one should not react toughly to this annexation attempt, which Russia started on September 30., But this thesis sounds nothing but the year 2014 - the mistakes of the then leaders. It sounds like 1938. It only says that the criminal can go unpunished. And so, with the temptation to continue., Be sure - the head of Russia is now carefully analyzing the world's reaction to the sham referenda he organized on Ukrainian soil and to the announcement of the annexation of our territory. What exactly is he interested in?, It’s simple: he is interested in whether he still has the potential for escalation., If the world's reaction is weak now, Russia will come up with some new escalation., You can see that the range of criminal actions of this state is very wide - missile terror, mass murders, criminal deportations, radiation blackmail at, for example, our captured Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, food crisis, energy crisis, etc., The recent sabotage with gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea was also very eloquent. These are actions that can destabilize life on the entire continent. This is a real energy weapon of mass destruction. Absolutely every country in the world depends on underwater cables and pipelines, which can be destroyed by an aggressor in the same way as gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea., Therefore, the world must now show strength., Strength is needed to finally put an end to aggression - to the aggressor's ability to escalate., On international platforms, a clear and principled condemnation of Russia for this attempt to annex Ukrainian territory is needed, for it to be utterly different from what happened in 2014., At the level of states and unions of states, new and tough sanctions against Russia are needed so that the situation is also dramatically different from 2014., At the level of cooperation with Ukraine, regular and demonstrative support packages are needed, primarily defensive and financial, so that the aggressor sees that his criminal actions only complicate the situation for him., Now, at a time that has such a strong connection with the past, we have a historic opportunity to set a precedent that will make the history of aggression truly history and that will teach any aggressor that no crime against international law will ever again remain unpunished., Next week, a resolution on non-recognition and condemnation of Russia's new attempt to annex our territories will be submitted to the UN General Assembly. We and Australia have long had a principled and effective cooperation at all international platforms, and in particular at the UN. And we must now direct our joint capabilities in such a way as to make the vote at the General Assembly for this resolution as unequivocal as possible. I am asking you, I am asking Australia to use all its influence to persuade as many countries as possible not to remain neutral and to vote for - for international law and against Russian annexation., Ukraine has a very meaningful defense cooperation with Australia as well., Even after my first address to the Parliament and people of Australia in March, your Government decided to provide Ukraine with bushmasters. I’m deeply grateful. These vehicles have proven themselves in real combat., The more weapons and ammunition we receive, in particular, artillery, drones, anti-aircraft defense, anti-tank and anti-ship weapons, the more tangible the responsibility for violation of international law will be for Russia and the less the aggressor will feel that he supposedly has room for escalation., The third element is sanctions., I thank Australia for participating in the global effort to impose sanctions on the aggressor for the war. But this pressure makes sense when it is constantly growing and when the aggressor does not have time to adapt to sanctions, does not have time to find ways to circumvent them., Now is the time to increase this pressure. Just now., Right after Russia staged this farce with sham referenda and this annexation., The price of such actions must be tangible, the consequences - devastating. The aggressor should have no illusions that 2014 can still happen again., And the last one., The world has seen many wars. It has seen how wars somewhere in one part of the world affect everyone in the world., It should be considered not only from the point of view of the direct negative impact of the war. But also from the point of view of the impact of its result., If the aggressor does gain a result for himself, if the aggressive ambition is satisfied, then such a result affects everyone in the world even more and even longer than the war itself., Affects by cynicism. Affects by the inevitable destruction of international law, the weakening of the truth., That is why the criminal war must end with the just defeat of the one who started it. The aggressor must lose. This is what gives peace to generations. Not any conspiracies with the aggressor, not appeasement of the aggressor, but his defeat. And therefore, the restoration of peace. And therefore, Ukraine must win., This is not just something about our state. This is about all of us in the world. This is also about Australia., About your freedom. About your security. About our common values. About our common peace. Which our victory can historically strengthen., I thank you for your attention! I thank you for the support, Australia!, Glory to Ukraine!"
6 October 2022  - 08:31 ,"We need your support to bring back peace faster - address by the President to the participants of the session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States, which is ongoing in Lima",", Dear Secretary-General!, Dear representatives of the free nations of America!, Dear friends!, I am grateful for the opportunity to address you at this particular time when we have entered a defining phase of our war for independence – when our heroes drive the occupying army out of our land. , Russia sent this army to our country to turn us into their colony. As it was, unfortunately, before – in the time of empires., But millions of Ukrainians stood up to defend our freedom and our country and will definitely not allow Russia to bring back that old unfair time., We have no doubts about winning this war and our ability to protect the independence of Ukraine. Daily victories at the front and dozens of liberated Ukrainian cities and villages prove it., There is only one question for us right now – how many of our people Russia will manage to kill before it admits a defeat. How much more will Russia manage to steal from Ukraine – grain; resources; industrial enterprises, which the occupiers simply disassemble and take out to Russia; as well as people. They are stealing people., More than one million and six hundred thousands of Ukrainians were forcibly deported to Russia. They are dispersed across the territory of this state, scattered throughout remote Russian regions. , Many of them had their documents taken away, and many of them passed through terrible Russia's filtration camps, where they were abused and intimidated., These are people. But for Russia, it is also a resource., We are doing everything to free our land as soon as possible, to save all our people from this invasion as fast as we can. We are doing everything to put an end to the long list of Ukrainian victims that Russia is creating., This is the reason I am addressing you., We need your support to bring back peace faster for our people., I will be honest – I know that in some member countries of your Organization, unfortunately, the Russian view of this war is dominant. And this is a false view., It is possible in your part of the world simply due to the fact that Russia spends billions of dollars annually on its propaganda media and other projects that create an illusory impression about it., But there are facts on the side of Ukraine. And I am asking you just to look at these facts., Look – from your point of view. In terms of what your great American continent has been through. From the point of view of the struggle for independence that your people led. In terms of simple human justice, which means so much to your countries and people. And in terms of what your national heroes fought for., I am turning to the pages of the history of the American continent and asking:, On whose side would Simon Bolivar be in such a war that Russia unleashed against Ukraine? Who would Jose de San Martin support? Who would Miguel Hidalgo sympathize with?, I think they would not help someone who is just looting a smaller country as a typical colonizer. I think they would not support someone who constantly lies and does not even call a war a war, hiding behind the definition of ""special military operation"". , I think they would not sympathize with someone who deliberately puts different countries on the brink of starvation – through an artificial food crisis. Who drives people into poverty – through price and energy crisis, both artificial. And who is so mean that he makes war against civilians, destroying all the foundations of normal social life using rockets and artillery against residential buildings, hospitals, schools, churches., I thank those of you who have already strongly supported Ukraine and condemned Russian war against our freedom and independence. I thank your Organization for suspending Russia's observer status., But we need more for the sake of peace and for the Russian army to leave all captured Ukrainian land., So I am asking you to support us on several levels., The first level – international organizations, particularly the UN General Assembly. Please support us in voting to condemn Russia's aggressive policy., It is of our common interest – so that no one in the world can start wars of aggression like the Russian war against Ukraine. And so that no one in the world thinks that he has right to illegally annex lands of other nations, as Russia thinks., The second level is national. We need integrity from your states. , Do not allow your economies to be used to finance criminal war and war crimes. Do not associate yourself with those who will inevitably be condemned by the international community., The crime of Russia's aggression against our country, the mass murders of civilians on Ukrainian soil, forced deportations, numerous cases of torture and rape – all this will certainly receive its verdicts., Please avoid your companies and countries to be connected with those individuals and legal entities in Russia through which it carries out its terror against Ukraine. Support sanctions against Russia. Limit your trade operations with Russia. Protect yourself from the risk of tarnishing your reputation with ties to a terrorist state and its companies, and limit its opportunities to continue this war of aggression against Ukraine., And the third level of support we need – is the level of ordinary people., I'm not asking for much. Just spread the truth about this war and the casualties caused by the Russian aggression. Just talk about it. Let your people know what evil Russia has brought to the absolutely peaceful Ukrainian people. A nation that has never started any wars of aggression., The greater the support for those who fight for freedom and independence – the stronger freedom will be in general in the world and the faster we will go all the way to freeing our land from the Russian invaders., I thank you for your attention! , Long live freedom! ¡Viva la Libertad!, Слава Україні!"
5 October 2022  - 22:49 ,The return of the flag of Ukraine to the de-occupied territories means that a peaceful and socially secure life becomes possible again - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. The main item on the agenda is our movement towards the liberation of all Ukrainian land and everything that is necessary for the implementation of our defense operation. The supply of weapons and ammunition, interaction with partners, material provision, countering new types of weapons that the occupiers have..., Of course, I cannot disclose specific issues that were discussed by the Staff. But most of the reports, accepted reports and approved plans will definitely please Ukrainians. And they will definitely upset the occupiers., Because they will be responsible for all their evil. They will be responsible before our weapons, the Ukrainian court and international law. None of them will avoid it., By the way, today I want to celebrate the personnel of the operative-strategic group ""Oleksandriya"" for creating conditions for a successful offensive, for planning and preparing active actions in the Kherson region. Those of our actions that already yield a tangible result. And there will be more., Only during this day in the Kherson region, such settlements as Novovoskresenske, Novohryhorivka and Petropavlivka were liberated from the sham referendum and stabilized. The movement continues., I also want to celebrate the warriors of our Air Forces, who today managed to shoot down six Iranian-made drones that the occupiers tried to use against our cities. Three drones were shot down by anti-aircraft troops of the 302nd anti-aircraft missile Kharkiv regiment, and three more were shot down by our fighter pilots from the 204th Sevastopol tactical aviation brigade. Thanks for the precision, guys!, And now I will address the occupiers., Even if you find some other weapon somewhere in the world with the same “natural” name for your “Russian world”, like these Iranian “Shahed”, with which you are trying to bomb our cities, such as Bila Tserkva... It won't help you anyway. You have already lost., You’ve lost because even now, on the 224th day of the full-scale war, you have to explain to your society why all this is needed: this war, the false mobilization and self-destruction of all the prospects of your people., When people feel they are right and when they are on their own land, they themselves know everything. They do not need fanatic lectures on ""alternative history"" and political information sessions every day - either at a meeting with teachers, or at a meeting about the progress of seasonal harvesting work., Ukrainians know what they are fighting for. And more and more citizens of Russia are realizing that they must die simply because one person does not want to end the war., It's obvious who will win., Today in Lyman, Sviatohirsk and Yarova of the Donetsk region, another sign of the return to normal life was added - we resumed the payment of pensions there. We also provide food kits and humanitarian aid. The return of the Ukrainian flag means that a peaceful and socially secure life is once again possible for Donbas and all other territories that were temporarily occupied by Russia., Today, we have several events that strongly confirm the world's faith in the future of Ukraine, the world's trust in our strength., First, we are starting Ukraine's accession to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It is one of the most prestigious global organizations, it unites 38 strongest states. These are democracies, these are market economies, this is the majority of the world's economic potential. From Austria to Japan, from the United States of America to South Korea, from Canada to Türkiye. Ukraine will be among them in this format as well., We submitted our application for admission, it was endorsed by the Organization. Ukraine received the special status of the acceding country. And we will fulfill all the necessary conditions for full membership., And already this year, the regional office of the Organization will start working in Kyiv. For us, this will mean another powerful line of economic, technological and value cooperation with the global community., The second event: together with our friends - Spain and Portugal - we submit a bid to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup., This is our joint bid. The chances of its success are quite high. And it's not just that our countries meet the criteria that must be complied with in order to gain the right to host the championship. The point is also that it will be very symbolic when three countries of the European Union: Spain, Portugal and Ukraine, will be able to hold the World Cup together., I spoke today with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. A very positive conversation. I thanked him for his support. We coordinated our next joint steps and interaction., I had a very substantive meeting in the afternoon regarding our preparations for the winter season., We are fully aware of all risks. And we know that the occupiers are also... preparing for winter., At all levels of government, scenarios are being worked out to protect people. We speak honestly: winter will be difficult. But in order to endure it, we accumulate gas, coal and everything else that is necessary. We are working to be ready., And it is important that our partners approach this period with the same preparedness., The more we do together now to bring peace closer, the more we cooperate and put pressure on Russia, the safer this winter can be for all of us in Europe., I will talk about this in particular tomorrow in my speech at the first summit of the European political community, which will be held in Prague., In addition, tomorrow I will speak with representatives of one of the most esteemed think tanks in the English-speaking world - the Lowy Institute in Australia., There will be other diplomatic activities., I thank everyone who fights and works for our victory!, I thank everyone who helps Ukraine and puts pressure on Russia for peace!, We will definitely win., Glory to Ukraine!"
5 October 2022  - 09:51 ,"We must create a Special Tribunal on the crime of aggression against Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the participants of the public debate ""War and Law"" in Paris",", Dear Mr. Fabius!, Ladies and Gentlemen!, I thank you for the opportunity to present our Ukrainian perspective on how law can guarantee peace. I will start with one example. An example, which demonstrates the need for a comprehensive legal response to aggression., September 30 of this year. Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine. Morning - 7:10 am. The Russian army fires 16 missiles at the territory of the region and the city of Zaporizhzhia. Of them, 4 missiles are shot down by our air defense forces. 9 missiles hit one of the plants, the enterprise was destroyed. And 3 more Russian missiles hit the checkpoint on the road - the place where dozens of people were. Ordinary people in ordinary cars., A total of 122 people were wounded that morning. 30 people died. Including 2 children. The girl was 10 years old. And the boy, he was 14 years old., And this is just one Russian missile strike. A deliberate attack on civilians. A deliberate crime. This is one of thousands of strikes that have occurred since 2014, when Russia began its aggression against Ukraine, and since February 24 of this year, when Russia turned this aggression into a full-scale war., You all know what is happening in Ukraine. All of you have heard about Bucha and Mariupol, about burned cities and tortured people. And I think many of you have read or heard words that explain very clearly why all this is happening., I will quote these words now: ""To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole."" End of quote., These are wise words. The words of people who saw full-scale war with their own eyes. They saw - and know that all war crimes begin with one original crime - the crime of aggression., What is the missile strike at ordinary people in ordinary cars at a checkpoint somewhere in the middle of the Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine? This is the crime committed by the specific Russian soldiers who launched the missiles. This is the crime of the specific commander who ordered the missile strike. And this is the crime of those who started the armed aggression against Ukraine, in the framework of which this and thousands of other similar strikes became possible. And also - in the framework of which the execution of civilians, the torture and execution of prisoners, the rape of women and children, airstrikes on ordinary residential buildings, the use of prohibited mines and ammunition became possible., All the crimes of the Russian occupiers on Ukrainian soil can be investigated and the perpetrators can be brought to justice. All perpetrators!, But... We must bring to justice those whose decisions started all this. Those who committed the original crime. A crime in which all the evil shown by the Russian occupiers is concentrated. And we still do not have such an institutional basis to hold the Russian political and military leadership accountable for the crime of aggression., Ladies and Gentlemen!, Ukraine offers a real way to bring to justice the perpetrators of the original crime that spawned all other crimes committed since the beginning of Russian aggression., For many years, the world has been looking for ways to prevent the recurrence of a full-scale war in Europe and to ensure the inevitability of punishment for war criminals, whoever they are, wherever they are and wherever they commit crimes against the basics of human life. Thanks to these searches and the efforts of many conscientious people, we now have, in particular, the International Criminal Court - one of the most important global legal institutions that ensures justice and protects humanity., Ukraine fully supports the activities of this court. We accepted the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court over all events on the territory of Ukraine. We introduced changes in the legislation of Ukraine to simplify and make our cooperation with this court more effective. We are in constant and quite practical communication with representatives of the International Criminal Court in order to achieve the common goal of bringing the Russian occupiers to justice for the crimes committed by them on the territory of Ukraine., I am grateful to all states and specialists who contribute to this work - with their financial, technical, analytical, legal and expert support. I am grateful to France, in particular, whose contribution is already tangible. And I believe that the International Criminal Court will be able to create a historical precedent of an absolutely legal response to the crimes committed by the Russian occupiers, as large-scale as the Russian war against Ukraine., But for the original crime of armed aggression to receive a fair answer as well, we must supplement the activities of the International Criminal Court., A Special Tribunal should be established for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. So that it can punish those who, unfortunately, cannot be reached by the International Criminal Court and all other available judicial institutions of the world., You all know how the leadership of Russia, hiding behind false stories about state sovereignty, avoids fair responsibility for what it has done. We have to overcome that., The draft of the corresponding international agreement for the establishment of the Special Tribunal was recently presented in Kyiv to diplomats from our partner countries. However, we offer this agreement not only to our partners, but also to everyone in the world who values international law and order., I will give you another quote: “The charges in the Indictment that the defendants planned and waged aggressive wars are charges of the utmost gravity. War is essentially an evil thing. Its consequences are not confined to the belligerent States alone, but affect the whole world.” End of quote., When we conclude an agreement and establish a Special Tribunal for Russian aggression, the very fact of preparing indictments and issuing arrest warrants for those who planned and ordered the beginning of this aggression will be the most powerful signal to all other potential aggressors in the world that war is inevitably punished, and the guilty are held accountable; that the law is always valid and the law always prevails; and humanity is guaranteed to be protected., That is why we say that law can guarantee peace and justice. It can! To all. But only if we create the necessary institution., And I invite France, in particular, your Constitutional Council to actively participate in the negotiations on the establishment of the Special Tribunal., And one more thing. Something without which post-war justice is simply impossible. This is the compensation for all losses and destruction., Already now, in October, we offer everyone who values international law to support a fundamental resolution at the UN General Assembly. A resolution confirming Russia's international legal obligation to pay reparations for this war and recognizing the need for a compensation mechanism through which such an obligation can be implemented. The aggressor must fully pay for the cruelty and destruction he unleashed., And although it is not easy in the case of Russia, it is quite possible. The corresponding order of legal steps is clear. We can present it to all interested parties., And I will now add one more quote: ""Crimes against International Law are committed by men, not by abstract entities, and only by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the provisions of International Law be enforced."" End of quote., Probably, you have read or heard these and other words that I have just given - they are from the verdict of the Nuremberg trials. The trials established by an international treaty. The trials that punished the perpetrators of the previous full-scale war in Europe and proved that justice exists in the world., All of us who have studied jurisprudence have seen and analyzed this fundamental document – the Nuremberg verdict. And I am sure that there will be times when students who study law in the same way will be able to compare the text of the Nuremberg verdict with the text of the verdict that will be passed by the Special Tribunal regarding the crime of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. But not only. They will also study the experience of Russia’s compensation for all the losses caused by this war., So, colleagues! Friends!, I invite all of you to participate in the establishment of appropriate legal institutions. Anyone who joins in restoring justice now will join in guaranteeing long-term peace for all of us in Europe and the world., No chance for the guilty! No chance for aggression! Let the law prevail., Thank you for your attention!, Thank you, France, for your support., Glory to Ukraine!"
4 October 2022  - 22:44 ,The Ukrainian army is carrying out a pretty fast and powerful advance in the south of our country - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today we’ve got some good news both from the frontline and from the diplomatic front., First: the Ukrainian army is carrying out a pretty fast and powerful advance in the south of our country as part of the current defense operation. Dozens of settlements have already been liberated from the Russian sham referendum this week alone. In Kherson region, Kharkiv region, Luhansk region and Donetsk region altogether., In particular, according to the military reports from the Kherson region: the settlements of Lyubymivka, Khreshchenivka, Zolota Balka, Bilyaivka, Ukrainka, Velyka and Mala Oleksandrivka, and Davydiv Brid were liberated from the occupier and stabilized. And this is far from a complete list..., Our warriors do not stop. And it's only a matter of time before we oust the occupier from all our land., I’ve held a series of important negotiations today., First, in the afternoon, I spoke with the Prime Minister of India. I informed Mr. Modi about the situation on the frontline, about the success of our military. I presented in detail our view of Russia's recent escalation steps. It is the Kremlin that is doing absolutely everything for this war to end only on the battlefield, not at the negotiating table., Russia responds to various Ukrainian proposals to stop aggression and liberate our territory with terror, criminal mobilization and political farce. And this is a threat to any state in any part of the world. After all, if someone tries to steal the territory of a neighboring people, then some others may have a similar desire., And that is why we call on all subjects of international relations who respect international law to stand up for its basic principles and confirm their respect, in particular, for the principle of the inviolability of borders and the territorial integrity of states., I believe this is the same fundamental principle for India as it is for Ukraine., Also this afternoon I spoke with Giorgia Meloni, leader of the Brothers of Italy political force that won the recent elections by a landslide. It was a very substantive conversation on the ways to further increase our interstate cooperation and strengthen our capabilities - both of Ukraine and Italy., On behalf of all Ukrainians, I thanked Italy for the powerful packages of defense support. We are looking forward to Mrs. Meloni’s official visit to Kyiv., And in the evening I spoke with U.S. President Biden. First of all, I thanked him for another package of defense support for our country, in particular for new HIMARS. And in general, I noted that the successes of our military - all successes in returning freedom to our people - are our joint successes, our joint victories., Due to the unity of Ukraine, the United States of America and all our partners in the free world, today freedom has the highest strength in decades and demonstrates concrete victories in the confrontation with tyranny., Of course, the key aspects of our cooperation outside the defense sphere were also discussed with President Biden, in particular financial support - in particular, the support package in the amount of more than 12 billion dollars. We also discussed political steps, cooperation in international organizations., And I was especially pleased to hear President Biden's words that our servicemen inspire the whole world, our people inspire the whole world. And rightly so. Our victory in this war will show how much Ukraine can contribute to the global strength of freedom, the global strength of democracy., I thank everyone who fights and works for our victory! Today, I would especially like to celebrate the concerted and heroic actions of the warriors of the 35th separate marine brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Ostrogradsky, the 46th separate assault brigade and the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade named after Kosh otaman Kost Hordiyenko. Thank you guys!, And I always thank everyone who helps our defenders protect freedom!, And one more important emphasis., I signed a decree designating null and void all decrees of the President of the Russian Federation and all acts adopted to implement these decrees for attempted annexation of our territory from 2014 until today. Any Russian decisions, any treaties with which they try to seize our land - all this is worthless., Glory to Ukraine!"
3 October 2022  - 23:44 ,"Ukraine appreciates people, saves people – these are fundamental rules for our state – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",",  Ukrainians!, Today, I will also begin my address with a message about what happened in Türkiye., Finally, we managed to organize a meeting of our boys, commanders from ""Azovstal"", with their relatives. The meeting is in Türkiye, where our warriors stay in accordance with the agreement on their release., They are completely safe – with the guarantees of President of Türkiye Erdoğan. They are provided with proper conditions. And now they can see their relatives., They have not seen each other for many months. And now I thank everyone who made it possible for them to be with their families again., And we will do everything to make such a meeting possible for the families of all Ukrainians who are still in Russian captivity one day – a meeting with their relatives., Ukraine appreciates people. Saves people. And helps all those who need help. These are fundamental rules for our state. And it will always be so., A large group of our officials continues the work on providing the necessary assistance to all those released from Russian captivity. As you understand, there are a lot of issues. This is not only treatment and rehabilitation, but also a large volume of social issues, often legal. The state will certainly help solve all of them., At the same time, everything is being done quite intensively at various levels of government to restore normal life in the areas liberated from the occupiers., In total, these are more than 450 settlements in the Kharkiv region alone – those that were liberated thanks to the defense operation that began in September and is still ongoing., The work of transport, post office, police, normal supply of water, gas, electricity is being restored – as much as possible. The occupiers left many mined areas, many tripwires, almost all infrastructure was destroyed. The damage is colossal., But life is returning – it is returning wherever the occupiers were driven out. We also make social payments – pensions, salaries. In particular, to the teachers who remained loyal to Ukraine and did not switch to the curriculum of the occupiers., This is actually very important. Russian propagandists intimidate people in the areas still under the control of the occupiers that Ukraine will allegedly consider almost everyone who remains in the occupied territory as collaborators. Absolute nonsense., Our approach has always been and remains clear and fair. If a person did not serve the occupiers and did not betray Ukraine, then there is no reason to consider such a person a collaborator. These are elementary things. If the teacher remained a Ukrainian teacher and did not lie to the children about who is the enemy... Or if a person remained a Ukrainian employee of the Ukrainian utilities service and, for example, helped preserve the energy supply for people, then such a person cannot be blamed for anything., Hundreds of thousands of our people were in the temporarily occupied territory. Many helped our military and special services. Many simply tried to survive and waited for the return of the Ukrainian flag., Of course, there were those who betrayed Ukraine. But such cases are quickly established by the Security Service of Ukraine and are not massive. Russia did not meet mass support in Ukraine, and this is a fact., Today, the offensive movement of our army and all our defenders continued. There are new liberated settlements in several regions., Fierce fighting continues in many areas of the front. But the perspective of these hostilities remains obvious - more and more occupiers are trying to escape, more and more losses are being inflicted on the enemy army, and there is a growing understanding that Russia made a mistake by starting a war against Ukraine., Of course, there are many fanatics out there. Those who will never admit the obvious, that this is a pointless war for Russia that Russia cannot win. Because it is impossible to defeat a nation that preserves unity and knows what they are fighting for., The same cannot be said about the people of Russia as about the Ukrainian people. None of those who are now being sent to war after criminal mobilization will be able to explain: what is the point of this for him personally? Why should he risk his life?, Among the dead occupiers we can already see those who were taken just a week or two ago. People were not trained for combat, they have no experience to fight in such a war. But the Russian command just needs some people - any kind - to replace the dead. And when these new ones die, more people will be sent. This is how Russia fights. That's how it will lose as well., No sham referenda, announcements about annexations, conversations about the borders they invented and drew somewhere, will help them., There is a clear and internationally recognized border of Ukraine. There are lives we must protect. There is security we must restore. And all this will happen. We are doing all this., And one more thing., Today, Russia was ultimately removed from decision-making in world aviation. There will be no more representatives of the terrorist state in the governing body – the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization. This is a crucially important world institution, a specialized agency of the UN, and this is a quite eloquent signal to all other international organizations., A state that has violated so many norms of international law cannot be kept in any international organizations as a supposedly normal participant. Russia has no place in the global community., I thank everyone who helps us defend freedom!, Glory to all who fight for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
2 October 2022  - 23:03 ,Ukraine was and will be one of the European centers of the military and aviation industry – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Dear Ukrainians! I wish you health!, Important events took place today in Turkey during a visit of the First Lady of Ukraine, the head of the President's Office and other our representatives., In the presence of Olena, the first corvette for our country from those, which will be built by the Turkish side, was launched. It is corvette Hetman Ivan Mazepa., Its building began in 2021 and will be completed in due time. I consider it very symbolic that it got this name. Despite a century of Russian false propaganda, historical truth and justice still prevail., And there is no reason for our project to build a new fleet for Ukraine to fail. We will implement all the shaped plans. Our goal is to create a full-fledged base for ship maintenance and building in Ukraine., Today, Andriy Yermak together with the Ukrainian delegation visited the facilities of the Baykar company, which produces, in particular, well-known Bayraktar UCAVs for us. On behalf of all Ukrainians, Andriy thanked the company's managers and presented Selçuk Bayraktar, the chairman of the Baykar's Board, with the Order of Merit, which was awarded to him on the anniversary of Ukraine's Independence., However, this meeting is not symbolic, it is quite practical. We are preparing to create a training center and a plant of the Baykar company in Ukraine, as well as joint manufacturing of aircraft engines. We will definitely implement these projects., Ukraine has always been and will be one of the European centers of the military and aviation industry. And I am proud that I can say these words with absolute confidence and justification based on the results of the 221st day of Russia's full-scale war against our state., Something went wrong with someone..., And these meetings are not the end of our diplomatic activity today., There was also a meeting of the first ladies of Ukraine and Turkey – and I thank President Erdoğan and his wife Emine for their continued support of our efforts to restore peace., The First Lady of Ukraine and our delegation met with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. Patriarch Bartholomew's view on the war unleashed by Russia and his position on supporting our state are well known. And today they sounded again – very powerfully. I thank you for this, thank you for understanding the needs of our people., The head of the Office held talks with the advisors to the President of the United States and the President of Turkey – Jake Sullivan and İbrahim Kalın. Very substantive negotiations. Absolutely in the interests of Ukraine. To strengthen our security., Today, I held talks with President of France Emmanuel Macron. We discussed in detail the situation on the front line, our successes at the front. President Macron clearly supported our state and condemned the Russian pseudo-referendums and the attempt to annex our territory. The strengthening of sanctions against Russia was discussed., We also discussed the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the abduction of Director General of the ZNPP Ihor Murashov by the Russian occupiers. This is another manifestation of completely frank Russian terror, for which the terrorist state must bear an ever-increasing punishment., Today, we have a powerful joint statement from the leaders of nine NATO states: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. They condemned Russia's escalating moves and, most importantly, supported our aspiration to become a full member of NATO. We are moving in this direction. I am sure that we will implement this project., At least twice a day – in the morning and in the evening – I receive reports from our military. This week, the largest part of the reports is the list of settlements liberated from the enemy as part of our defense operation. The story of the liberation of Lyman in Donetsk region has now become the most popular in the media. But the successes of our soldiers are not limited to Lyman., This, you know, is the trend... Recently, someone somewhere held pseudo-referendums, and when the Ukrainian flag is returned, no one remembers the Russian farce with some pieces of paper and some annexations. Except, of course, law enforcement agencies of Ukraine. Because everyone who is involved in any elements of aggression against our state will be accountable for it., And I thank everyone who brings these moments of victory closer, who returns the Ukrainian flag to its rightful place on Ukrainian land. I thank everyone: from generals to ordinary soldiers, from professional soldiers, intelligence and special forces to volunteers and everyone who helps defend our state., And I would especially like to mention the 25th, 80th, 81st, and 95th brigades of amphibious assault troops for their successes in the east of our country; 14th and 92nd separate mechanized brigades; 1st, 4th and 17th tank brigades; Special Operations Forces; units of the National Guard and the National Police; SBU employees; and our intelligence – Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense. Thank you, warriors!, And one more thing., Today, two professional holidays are celebrated in Ukraine – Teacher's Day (Educator's Day) and Territorial Defense Forces Day. Of course, a lot of kind and warm words have already been said to both educators and our Territorial Defense Forces men. But I want to add something., Effective defense is impossible without good national education. And there will be no good national education without effective defense. Fortunately, we have both of these elements. Thanks to the professionalism and conscientiousness of Ukrainian educators, teachers, and professors, we have soldiers who know what humanity is and appreciate everything that Ukraine represents. And thanks to our brave soldiers, Ukrainian education on Ukrainian land will transmit our values to all generations of our people., I thank every Ukrainian educator, teacher and lecturer! I thank each of our defenders!, I'm thankful to the soldiers of the 127th Territorial Defense Brigade for defending the city of Kharkiv and liberating the territory of Kharkiv region. To the soldiers of the 110th brigade, who bravely repulsed the invaders in the Zaporizhzhia direction. To the soldiers of the 129th brigade of my native Kryvy Rih, who distinguished themselves with good results and liberated, in particular, Arkhanhelske and Myroliubivka. To the soldiers of the 115th Territorial Defense Brigade, who made a significant contribution to the defense of Zhytomyr region. And also to the soldiers of the 117th brigade, who defend the north-eastern direction in Sumy region., Ukraine will win!, Glory to Ukraine!"
1 October 2022  - 21:28 ,"During this week more Ukrainian flags appeared in Donbas, there will be even more – address of President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians!, Dear all our defenders!, Another week of our war for our independence comes to an end., The week that the enemy really wanted to make especially hard for us, but he made it really hard, but for himself. For Russia itself., Today, even more voices in the world have joined in condemning the pseudo-referendums and Russia's attempt to annex our territory – the territory of Ukraine., I am grateful for every such voice., As a result, we already have dozens of statements that clearly support Ukraine and international law and condemn Russia for this new aggressive step., I would like to especially note the statement of UN Secretary General António Guterres., He bluntly said that Russia violates the goals and principles of the UN, the UN Charter and that the pseudo-referendums and attempted annexation will have no legal force., When such words are heard at the highest level in the UN, everyone in the world understands everything., And Russia has no such veto right that can stop or cancel this understanding of the world., Russia is losing the fight for the international community. The world will not allow a return to the times of colonial conquests, criminal annexations and total arbitrariness instead of international law., And the main thing... The main thing is our resistance with you, our protection with you, our movement with you towards the liberation of the entire Ukrainian territory., It is our movement that puts everything in its place., Russia has staged a farce in Donbas. An absolute farce, which it wanted to present as an alleged referendum., They depicted something there, drove machine gunners around the houses, carried pieces of paper, the propagandists filmed all this in the part of Donbas they controlled., And now a Ukrainian flag is there., During this week, there were more Ukrainian flags in Donbas. It will be even more in a week., What then is a pseudo-referendum? Are there two Donetsk regions? Two villages of Yampil, Donetsk region? Are there two villages of Torske?, The Ukrainian movement will continue., The Ukrainian flag is already in Lyman, Donetsk region. Fighting is still going on there. But there is no trace of any pseudo-referendum there., It is logical for Ukraine. And for the enemy, there will be more and more such ""mismatches."", By the way, they have already started biting each other there: they are looking for the culprits, accusing some generals of failures..., This is the first bell that should be heard at all levels of the Russian government., Until you all solve the problem with the one who started it all, who started this senseless for Russia war against Ukraine, you will be eliminated one by one, making scapegoats, so as not to admit that this war is a historical mistake for Russia., Ukraine will return its own. Both in the east and in the south. And what they tried to annex now, and Crimea, which has been called annexed since 2014., Our flag will be everywhere., There will be punishment for those who committed this crime of aggression against our independent state., On October 1, 76 years ago, the Nuremberg Tribunal ended its work., In many ways, it was this process that laid the foundations of the modern world – the legal foundations of justice. Everything that ruscism is trying to destroy., Therefore, another tribunal will inevitably take place, which will put an end to the careers of all those responsible for this Russian ""special operation"" against the international system, which began in 2014 and became full-scale on February 24, and will end thanks to the heroism of our people., Today, we still do not know on which day it will happen. But we know that the day of our victory will come. It will definitely be. And after it the day of judgment for the ruscists will be. It will definitely be., I thank everyone who brings this time closer. Who is approaching it daily., Thanks to everyone who fights and works for our victory! Thanks to everyone who helps!, Thank you to President Biden and the US Congress for providing more than $12 billion in supplemental support. It will definitely strengthen our common freedom., Glory to the invincible people of Ukraine!, Glory to our soldiers!, Glory to Ukraine!"
30 September 2022  - 21:43 ,"Our path is path of independence, territorial integrity, integration with civilized world, path of Russia is defeat and shame – address of President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians!, The enemy started this day with a deliberate and absolutely premeditated murder of Ukrainians in Zaporizhzhia. A missile attack on a civilian convoy of cars., As of now, 30 dead are reported. Almost a hundred wounded and traumatized., The Russian military knew where their missiles would hit. Non-humans did it. From the first to the last. From the one who gave this order and to everyone who executed this order. They will answer. For sure. Before the law and before people. People!, That is why we are confident of our victory. That is why we took the initiative in the war. That is why we're getting tangible results on the battlefield right now... and that's very important. Congratulations to the heroes!, As we remain human and gain support from people – from all the people of the world. From everyone who feels pain when they learn about the deliberate killing of innocent people., Another farce took place in Moscow today. Something was celebrated there. They were chanting something there. They sang in the square. They were talking about Zaporizhzhia... When they themselves arranged such a thing in Zaporizhzhia. They are non-humans. Eternal memory to all those killed in Russian terrorist attacks!, Today, Ukraine made decisions to defend itself. All of them will be implemented. Decisions of the National Security and Defense Council and the Supreme Commander-in-Chief Headquarters., I already reported in detail this afternoon about our request for an accelerated accession to join NATO. And about the obvious readiness of Ukraine for negotiations with the Russian Federation – but with another President of Russia, who will understand what is happening., Now, I want to add something about the decision of the National Security and Defense Council regarding sanctions against Russian individuals and legal entities. There is a really long list, quite famous names., However, we are not focused on volume, but on actually dismantling Russian influence and at the same time influencing the state of affairs in the Russian Federation itself., Therefore, restrictions are introduced against several thousand individuals and entities. Sanctions of Ukraine and our partners are synchronized. New sanctions are being introduced against key persons and significant Russian enterprises., Of course, sanctions will also be applied to those citizens of other countries who took part in the Russian farce on the occupied territory of our country., Pseudo-referendums are elements of aggression against a sovereign state, and anyone involved in organizing or conducting this farce will be held accountable., Today, I spoke with the Prime Ministers of Japan and Denmark. Of course, they condemned the new Russian steps towards escalation. Thanks to them for their support!, Thanks also to all the leaders of the partner states, to all the political and public figures of the world, who have already quite promptly spoken out in defense of Ukraine and international law!, I personally thank President Biden, Congress, our friends in Europe and everyone who is already strengthening sanctions against Russia and is already taking powerful steps to increase defense and financial support for Ukraine!, We must liberate our entire land, and this will be the best proof that international law and human values cannot be broken by any terrorist state, even one as insolent as Russia., We have substantial results in the east of our country. There is already enough public information about this. Everyone has heard what is happening in Lyman, Donetsk region. These are steps that mean a lot to us., And I am thankful to all our fighters for implementing this element of our defense plan! It is very important., Today, I especially want to recognize the fighters of the 10th separate mountain assault brigade and the 54th separate mechanized brigade for their constant bravery and heroism in the Siversky and Bakhmut areas. And also our servicemen of the 214th separate rifle battalion, the Special Operations Forces and the 103rd separate ground defense brigade for the liberation of Yampil., I am also thankful to our intelligence units – Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense, as well as the Security Service of Ukraine., The path of our country is difficult. The path is clear. This is the path of independence, territorial integrity, integration with the civilized world and social development. The path of our enemy is also completely clear – defeat, shame and condemnation., And one more. Every year on the last day of September, Ukraine celebrates Adoption Day. This, in my opinion, is an important day., It is a day of special respect for those whose hearts are big enough to give family warmth to children left without parental care., Today, I thank all such Ukrainian men and women! I dream that we will come to such a result, when every child of Ukraine will feel family warmth, no matter what the circumstances of life are., Eternal glory to our beautiful people! Eternal glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine! We work for one thing – victory!, Glory to Ukraine!"
30 September 2022  - 17:02 ,We are taking our decisive step by signing Ukraine's application for accelerated accession to NATO - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Ukrainians! , And all our friends and allies!, De facto allies. Today, here in Kyiv, in the heart of our country, we are taking a decisive step for the security of the entire community of free nations., We see who threatens us. Who is ready to kill and maim. Who in order to expand his zone of control does not stop at any savagery., On February 24, the first full-scale attack on Ukraine was carried out. The first!, Russia would not have stopped at our borders if we had not stopped it. Other states would have been under attack. The Baltic countries, Poland, Moldova and Georgia, Kazakhstan..., Russia claimed to subjugate various nations of Europe and Asia. Claimed six months ago. This criminal ambition is breaking down in Ukraine. It was broken down in the suburbs of Kyiv and Chernihiv. In ""Azovstal"". In the Sumy region and Kharkiv region. On Zmiinyi Island. It will be broken down in Donbas and in the south of Ukraine when we liberate them. Definitely - in Crimea, in the free Ukrainian Crimea., The entire territory of our country will be liberated from this enemy - the enemy not only of Ukraine, but also of life itself, humanity, law and truth., Russia already knows this. It feels our power. It sees that it is here, in Ukraine, that we prove the strength of our values. And that is why it is in a hurry. Organizes this farce with the attempted annexation. Tries to steal something that does not belong to it. Wants to rewrite history and redraw borders with murders, torture, blackmail and lies., Ukraine will not allow that., Today I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The meeting of the National Security and Defense Council has just ended. We have a decision., First – it is only the path of strengthening Ukraine and ousting the occupiers from our entire territory that restores peace. We will complete this path., Second – Ukraine was and remains a leader in negotiation efforts. It was our state that always offered Russia to reach an agreement on coexistence on equal, honest, decent and fair terms. It is obvious that this is impossible with this Russian president. He does not know what dignity and honesty are. Therefore, we are ready for a dialogue with Russia, but already with another president of Russia., And third – we must de jure record everything we have already achieved de facto. It is in Ukraine that the fate of democracy in the confrontation with tyranny is being decided. It is here, with the firmness of our state borders, that we can secure the firmness of the borders of all European states. We can guarantee that no one else will dare to bring war back to our continent., It is here, in Ukraine, that the values of our Euro-Atlantic community have obtained real vital energy. The strength of the nation that fights for freedom, and the strength of the nations that help in this fight., We are de facto allies. This has already been achieved. De facto, we have already completed our path to NATO. De facto, we have already proven interoperability with the Alliance’s standards, they are real for Ukraine - real on the battlefield and in all aspects of our interaction., We trust each other, we help each other and we protect each other. This is what the Alliance is. De facto., Today, Ukraine is applying to make it de jure. Under a procedure consistent with our significance for the protection of our entire community. Under an accelerated procedure., We know it's possible. We have seen Finland and Sweden start accession to the Alliance this year without a Membership Action Plan., This is fair. This is also fair for Ukraine. This is the consolidation at the level of the treaty of what has already been achieved in life and what are our values., We understand that this requires the consensus of all members of the Alliance. We understand that it is necessary to reach such a consensus. And therefore, while this is happening, we offer to implement our proposals regarding security guarantees for Ukraine and all of Europe in accordance with the Kyiv Security Compact, which was developed and presented to our partners., Security has no alternatives. But determination is needed to guarantee it., We are taking our decisive step by signing Ukraine's application for accelerated accession to NATO.,  , Today, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine adopted a decision to impose sanctions on significant individuals and legal entities of Russia who did not have the courage to speak out in defense of humanity and international law, or who in one way or another are involved in aggressive steps against Ukraine and the community of democratic nations., And at the same time, I am addressing the people's deputies of Ukraine: at the next session of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, a draft law on the nationalization of all Russian assets will be considered, which should significantly simplify this procedure. Please endorse this bill without delay., We are completing the dismantling of Russian influence on Ukraine, Europe and the world., Glory to Ukraine!"
29 September 2022  - 22:06 ,"When we oust Russia, normal life will return to Ukrainian land – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Ukrainians!, We continue our diplomatic activity to ensure that all partners of Ukraine and the countries of the world understand what new steps towards escalation are being taken by the terrorist state these days., I spoke today with President of Poland Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi. I had a meeting with the President of the National Assembly of France. I am grateful to our partners for clearly condemning the Russian sham referenda, for condemning the attempted annexation of our territory, which the Kremlin is currently preparing., I am grateful to our Polish brothers for their invaluable defense support and our cooperation for the sake of common security. And today, in a conversation with Andrzej Duda, with Mr. President, we discussed how we can further strengthen our relations., We also discussed cross-border cooperation. We must do everything so that our nations face no obstacles for economic and any other relations., I would like to thank Prime Minister Draghi for his principled condemnation of Russia's steps towards escalation. We exchanged views on further steps in our bilateral relations with Italy and in multilateral relations at the EU level that could give all of us in Europe more protection., The first ever visit to Ukraine by the President of the National Assembly of France is taking place at a truly historic time. At a time when solidarity between leaders at all levels is critical to the future of a democratic world. I thanked Mrs. President of the National Assembly of France and her fellow parliamentarians for their willingness to continue to help us defend the independence of Ukraine and the freedom of the whole of Europe., I talked today with the university community and public figures of Switzerland on the basis of the University of Zurich. It is very important that Switzerland and its citizens do not remain neutral, and support our aspiration to live - to live freely and in peace., Everyone in the world understands well what such an attempted annexation would actually mean. It will not mean what the Kremlin hopes for., Today I explained this to the peoples of the Caucasus, Siberia, and other indigenous peoples of Russia. And now I repeat for everyone in this country: Russia will not get a new territory of Ukraine. Russia will annex itself to the catastrophe that it has brought to the occupied territory of our country. Russia will equate itself with the so-called ""DPR"" and ""LPR"", and will completely finish off those institutions of normal statehood that still remained in Russia., The occupier fills the occupied territory of Ukraine with graves, and there are more and more graves on the territory of Russia itself. The occupier sets up torture chambers in the occupied territory - and will fill the entire territory of Russia with torture chambers. This is the only way the Russian police and Russian special services will work now. The law in Russia has been obliterated. And those who brought all these deaths, torture, rape from Russia will take them home., Everywhere in the seized territory, the occupier destroys any basis for life - economy, social sphere, culture..., Depriving the entire Russian society of a normal economy, a decent life and respect for any human value will be the price for the fact that one person in Russia wants this war to continue., This can still be stopped. But to stop it, you have to stop that one in Russia who wants war more than life. Your life, citizens of Russia., Today, the Russian army inflicted another vile attack on civilians in Mykolaiv - a shell exploded near a public transport stop. There are dead, there are wounded... Again shelling of Kharkiv, the Sumy region, fierce shelling in Donbas, in the south of Ukraine., All this can be stopped in only one way: liberation. And before Russia came, there was normal life everywhere on Ukrainian land. And when Russia leaves, when we oust it, normal life will return. This is the only way. This is the way to our victory., We cannot know how long it will take to complete this path. But we know that no Russian manipulation and no Russian crime can push us off this path., Today we managed to release six more of our citizens from Russian captivity. I am thankful to everyone who ensures this work!, Today we have new results on the frontline., Today we received additional elements of aid from partners., It will continue to be so., Tomorrow is another day of our struggle, another day on the path to victory. Will it be special for us? It will be another day that will bring us closer to security and peace, to restoration of our territorial integrity. Because millions of Ukrainians fight and work for this., A special meeting of the National Security and Defense Council, which I convened, will take place tomorrow. There will be decisions., We know how to react to any Russian actions., And finally. This morning I honored the memory of all the victims of the Babyn Yar. Eternal memory to the victims of Nazism! Eternal damnation to those who repeat the crimes of the Nazis!, Glory to Ukraine!"
29 September 2022  - 20:21 ,"Address by the President of Ukraine to the indigenous peoples of Russia: Fight to avoid death, defend your freedom in the streets and squares",", Peoples of the Caucasus!, Now I am in that part of Kyiv, where Imam Shamil, the hero of Dagestan and the entire Caucasus, lived in the 1860s. As you can see, Ukraine knows how to honor your heroes. We preserve the memory of those places that combined the cultures of our peoples., This is the center of our capital. One of the hundreds of Ukrainian cities against which the Russian authorities direct missiles, bombs and troops. The Caucasus knows what this means. The Caucasus saw it., For 218 days, we have been defending ourselves against those who have more missiles and people than we do, but who are completely devoid of decency. This is a vile war on the part of Russia, a criminal one. And we do everything to protect our people and the independence of Ukraine. This is our sacred duty. Duty to our parents. Duty to our children. Duty to all generations of our people - those who lived and those who will live on our land. We don't need what’s not ours!, Already 58,500 Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine. They came to kill us and died. You are not told this number. You are being lied to about the alleged death toll of about six thousand. 58.5! That's the truth. All of them died because one person wanted this war. Only one, which many people serve., Peoples of the Caucasus! All peoples on the territory of Russia! You have no reason to be among these many who still serve the one who wants this war. You do not have to die in Ukraine. Your sons do not have to die in Ukraine. You have no such obligation. Not to your parents, not to your children, not to your future, not to the future of your land. And you know it., We see that you are resisting the criminal mobilization with which the Russian authorities want to cover up their failure. The failure of their regular army, their criminal orders. You are being lied to that there are allegedly no such failures., Instead of ending the senseless war for Russia, the Russian authorities are trying to send new people to replace the dead. What awaits them all? You know the answer., Ukraine will continue to defend itself and will win in this war waged against us. Because we are on our land. The truth is on our side. And the whole civilized world is with us. We are fighting for what is true for any people on the planet - for life and freedom, for the right to happiness for all our families, for all our children., Russia was left alone. It is already isolated and will be condemned for this war. ""Anyone who raises a weapon against the truth raises it to his own destruction,"" the Kremlin seems not to be aware of these words by Imam Shamil. But these words should be known in the Caucasus. They should be heard in Siberia and in all other lands from which people are being sent to this war., And now there’s mobilization. Fight to avoid death! Defend your freedom now in the streets and squares, so that later you don't have to fight in the mountains and forests simply for your right to live, when the Russian authorities start the next waves of mobilization., Did you believe that they would take only 300 thousand people? The one who started this war will not stop at the first wave of mobilization, there will be more. He will try to take other lives as well., He doesn’t care about people. He respects neither the living nor the dead…, Thousands of bodies of dead Russian soldiers from various regions remain in Ukraine. They rot in the fields, they are stored in morgues., Those that were not burned by the Russian army itself. The only army in the world that carries around mobile crematoria to dispose of the bodies of its fallen soldiers when it has time to do so. But now it is fleeing so fast that it even leaves tanks and MLRS behind, not just the bodies of the dead., Just think about what it has come to! We are forced to start informational work on conveying to the citizens of Russia, who are being mobilized now, a special thesis: at least get a tattoo with your name and surname so that we know how to find your relatives when you are killed and do not even have an army token with you. The Russian authorities send people to this war without army tokens, often without documents! They do this on purpose to make it easier to lie to you about how many people actually die here. This is their special operation. Special operation on lies, terror, extermination of indigenous peoples., During the first week of criminal mobilization, more men fled from Russia than the Russian authorities were officially going to send to war. And how does the Kremlin react to this? It is sending troops to the border of Russia against the very citizens of Russia! This is a disgrace! And lies with some sham referenda, with some confessions and annexations will end in even greater disgrace for Russia., No one has to take part in a disgraceful war. Dagestanis do not have to die in Ukraine. Chechens, Ingush, Ossetians, Circassians and any other peoples who came under the Russian flag. In total, almost 200 different peoples... You know who sends them to Ukraine. The one who sends wants to make them ""cargo 200""., Do you want that? No? I'm sure you want to live. I'm sure you're tired of being lied to. I’m sure you know that it is necessary to fight now!, In order for Russian citizens to go to war, they are artificially driven into poverty. Into loans. People are intimidated by repressions, harassed by propaganda. You can change it. You just need to understand who is a real symbol for you, who is a hero for you, who is the pride of your history, and who just wants to take advantage of you., Fight! And you are sure to win!"
28 September 2022  - 23:10 ,"The greater unity we have, the more tangible Russian defeats are - President of Ukraine at the Athens Democracy Forum",", Dear Mrs. President!, Dear forum participants!, Everyone who values the democratic system and wants to preserve it for future generations!, There are many discussions about democracy in the world now. About what threatens democracy. About how democracy can be protected. And about what needs to be done so that democracy still prevails in the global confrontation., People feel that right now something is happening that could become decisive in the centuries-old confrontation between democracy and tyranny., And it is precisely in this address, precisely to the Athens Democracy Forum, that I want to say that I am sure: we will be able to guarantee the future of democracy, we will be able to protect it., We will, because we know what gives democracy strength, what serves as its heart, ensuring the supply of freedom, like blood, to every part of a democratic society - to every person. This is unity. Unity is the most important thing., Democracy is the rule of law, it is respect, it is procedures, it is the equality of the free and freedom for all. But all this works only under the condition of unity, only then is all this saturated with real freedom, all this is solid., Unity makes democracy alive., When societies are completely atomized, when there are no stable ties between peoples, when someone may not come to the aid of another in a democratic community, democracy gets weaker, lags behind, falls apart., We have seen this more than once in history., We have seen how a small but energetic and maximally united tyrannical minority or party is able to subjugate the social majority, if the majority of people are scattered and do not trust each other., We have seen how some democracies decided not to intervene when other democracies were threatened, but later everyone had to defend themselves, not just those who were threatened at the beginning., We have seen that people can become disillusioned with democracy if they feel unequal and humiliated, if people lose emotional connection with their representatives in power. The consequence of this can be fascination with someone autocratic. And then?... Often a tyrant begins to destroy his own society just to retain his personal power. This is exactly what happened in Russia over the past 30 years., So unity is the universal answer., Unity in society - for people to feel a connection with each other, for people to have something in common and for this commonality to develop, giving more freedom, more comfort, more well-being., Unity between societies, between states. All democracies should act in a united fashion, be a real community, and help each other when necessary. This is not only a matter of relations between the leaders of the states. This is not a question of who is or is not historically related to whom. This is a question of struggle for a democratic system. , When we are truly together, no one will be an insurmountable threat to us., We see this now in the war that Russia has waged against our people and against our common democratic system. The greater unity we have, the more tangible Russian defeats are., And the third element - this is very important for every democratic country - unity between those in whose hands the power is and those who entrusted this power., Democracy does not live in the government offices or even in the parliament hall. Democracy lives between people. And that is why it is so important that there are no isolated groups in societies - be it the ruling group, or any other privileged groups, or any unintegrated minorities., After the full-scale invasion of Russia into Ukraine, we managed to achieve the greatest unity of Europe and the democratic community of the whole world in decades. But the greatest does not mean the maximum., We have a lot to do to further strengthen our unity. And every such step to strengthen is a step to protect democracy. Not just somewhere, not just in some country, but in general – for all of us and for our children., For all free nations. Forever free., I thank you for your attention! Thank you, Greece, for your significant support!, And it is with great honor that I accept the award of the city of Athens for the Ukrainian people, for our people, for their contribution to the protection of democratic values., Glory to Ukraine!"
28 September 2022  - 22:52 ,Ukraine cannot and will not put up with Russia's attempts to seize any part of our land - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Our key task now is to coordinate actions with partners in response to sham referenda organized by Russia and all related threats. This is not 2014. Everything is clear for everyone. And there will certainly be actions., I’ve held a whole series of negotiations today. President of Türkiye Erdoğan, Chancellor of Germany Scholz, Prime Minister of Canada Trudeau, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Truss, Secretary-General of the UN Guterres, President of the European Council Charles Michel., Thank you all for your clear and unequivocal support. Thank you all for understanding our position. Ukraine cannot and will not put up with any attempts by Russia to seize any part of our land., I once again thanked President Erdoğan today for his help in freeing our people from Russian captivity. Commanders from Azovstal, who are in Türkiye, will soon be able to see their relatives. We are working on it., Also, by the way, the implementation of the plan to help each of those recently released from captivity has already begun. They receive priority elements of assistance. First of all, it is medical support - they all need recovery after what they had to go through in captivity. This work is under the control of the Ombudsman, representatives of the Office, intelligence, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Security Service of Ukraine, the Ministry of Health, and the command of the Medical Forces. And we will extend the appropriate measures, which are being worked out in detail now, to all our people whom we free from the captivity of the occupiers., I will emphasize once again: we remember all our people and try to free each and every one of them from captivity, not a single Ukrainian has been forgotten., We discussed today with President Erdoğan our further defense cooperation, our response to all the aggressive steps that Russia has already taken and is still preparing to take., We discussed a wide range of issues with the Chancellor of Germany - political, financial, defense, energy. In the defense topic, I emphasized that we are waiting for an anti-missile defense system from Germany - I’m grateful for the willingness to help with air defense. Other points of defense cooperation were also discussed in detail - there are quite a lot of them, they are clear. Of course, energy issues were touched upon, including the supply of gas to Europe and sabotage at the Nord Stream gas pipeline., We discussed with Mr. Chancellor the preparation of the new sanctions package of the European Union - together we must make it really powerful, not symbolic. As of today, there is still something to add to the eighth sanctions package., The conversation with the Prime Minister of Canada was, as always, very specific and concerned primarily how Canada can increase support for Ukraine. Among other things, demining was discussed. Canada has both the appropriate technology and the appropriate humanitarian ambitions., I invited Prime Minister Trudeau to lead a global effort to clear our land of Russian mines and projectiles. Due to the Russian war, Ukrainian land is one of the most contaminated by mines in the world. And while there are similar examples of large-scale mine contamination around the world, we must do what others have not done: we must set a precedent for rapid and large-scale demining, not leave this problem for decades. I thank Canada for its willingness to help us., With Mrs. Liz Truss, we discussed the possibilities of Britain in enhancing sanctions on Russia, as well as in increasing defense aid for our country. I am grateful for the principled condemnation of the Russian farce under the guise of a referendum, for the full support and willingness to move with us towards the return of freedom to all our people - in all parts of Ukraine, without any exceptions., The conversation with the Secretary-General of the UN also concerned sham referenda and Russia's apparent preparation of the ground for an attempt to annex our territory. These brutal violations of the UN Charter must be punished., We discussed the implementation of our grain export initiative with Mr. Guterres. We agreed that the initiative should not only be preserved, not only protected from any attempts to disrupt it, but also expanded. Ukraine is ready to significantly increase the export of our agricultural products to the countries that need them and the corresponding interaction with the UN for humanitarian purposes and assistance to such countries as Somalia, Ethiopia, etc., I have just finished a call with Charles Michel. As always, it was a conversation between real friends. Thank you for your full support in the issue of sham referenda and for your willingness to extend aid to Ukraine. Of course, we also discussed the preparation of new sanctions., Tomorrow I will continue intensive communication with the leaders., And today I want to once again thank the United States of America and personally President Biden for the new package of defense support for our country in the amount of more than 1 billion dollars. This is really important., If someone in Russia thinks they can ""get away"" with everything they are doing in the occupied territory, if someone in Russia hopes the world will abandon its own values, frightened by another Russian announcement of annexation, they in Russia are wrong. Each subsequent escalating step by the occupier only confirms the fact that the world must act even tougher., In the evening, I signed another decree awarding our defenders. State awards were awarded to: 71 warriors of the National Guard, 21 employees of the State Emergency Service, 52 border guards. 320 combatants were awarded for their brave and effective actions during the liberation of the districts of the Kharkiv region from the occupation., As for the situation at the front, everything is clear to us. Therefore, I repeat again… For those who understand only Russian., If you want to live, run. If you want to live, surrender. If you want to live, fight on your streets for your freedom. Everything was taken from you anyway. Or maybe any of you have oil rigs? Palaces? Vineyards? Maybe yachts? Or some bank? What are you fighting for? The only thing you have is loans, something to eat in the evening and now there’s mobilization. Fight for what’s yours! Stay away from our land, our soul and our culture., Glory to Ukraine!"
28 September 2022  - 09:37 ,To act preventively means to prevent catastrophic damage from further actions of Russia - address by the President of Ukraine to students and lecturers of Harvard University,", Dear students and lecturers!, The great Harvard community!, Thank you for the opportunity to address you., I have a little more than a few words as in the invitation to this speech I was offered to focus on two topics: peace and leadership. And it seems to me this is a good offer. So I'd like to talk about that first, and then I'm sure we'll have plenty of time to talk and I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have., What we all strive for is peace. And what makes it possible to realize our aspirations is leadership. I'll start with a few examples., Literally today, another blackmailing statement about nuclear weapons was made in Moscow. The Russian leadership is trying its hardest to give us all the impression that they are willing to use nuclear weapons., All day long there are statements that they are willing to annex another part of the Ukrainian territory. They say that there are supposedly no obstacles to annexation., A statement on the grain export corridor was also made. A statement, which obviously prepares the conditions for Russia to once again disrupt the export of agricultural products of Ukraine and thereby again put dozens of African and Asian countries at risk of starvation., What is accompanied by all this? That’s my question. Russia either speaks openly or means that the world will simply ""swallow"" all this: nuclear blackmail, criminal annexation, and yet another mass famine, which the Kremlin knows well how to organize., Do you consider such a situation tolerable?, When someone alone threatens everyone. When someone alone thinks he has the right to kill and starve. When someone alone has become so insolent that it is no longer enough for him to steal money or resources from his own territory, now he wants to steal from the territory of others as well., I think this is not normal for all of us. Even at the level of rhetoric, these are already crimes. Nuclear blackmail, annexations, starvation and anything of a kind even at the level of claims about it deserve tough actions. I think so. Actions to prevent any catastrophic scenario. But what actions do we see in response to the statements coming from Russia? This is a fundamental question about leadership., You must have a special sense of leadership here at Harvard University. Harvard is one of the world's most powerful sources of leadership. Hundreds of different leaders of politics, jurisprudence, science, business, and other spheres of human activity received education and key skills here. And in those who were really successful, you can notice one common feature. It is the ability to act first. To act in advance. To act when the majority does not yet understand that it is necessary to act. Or vice versa - when everyone already understands everything, but is so afraid of terrible consequences that they simply freeze when it is necessary to neutralize their cause before it explodes into a catastrophe., This is prevention. Prevention is a key aspect of leadership. And it is in politics that it works most obviously., We all know that seat belts should be used in the car. They save us from the consequences that may occur if an accident occurs. We don't wait for an accident to personally verify that seat belts are required. We trust the experience of those accidents that have already happened., Many of us - if not all - use insurance services. They may be different, but they are arranged in approximately the same way: in case of negative consequences, a person receives compensation according to the terms of the contract. The insurance contract enters into force before anything happens and acts as a guarantee - a guarantee of protection., For all of us, it is normal when a murderer is isolated after a conviction. We know that this is not only a retribution for the crime committed, but also a way to protect society from another murder that could happen if the murderer remains at large. No one wants to wait for the second murder to make sure that the killer is definitely a killer. He is convicted for the very first murder. And that's right. And it can be life imprisonment - in the case of a particularly dangerous act committed by a person., All these are realities. All this is the principle of prevention. It is with us in ordinary life to give us the security of this life. This is also how prevention should work when solving political issues and in international relations. Should work., This is what we’ve been saying last year, when the world watched as Russia brought its army to the border of Ukraine for a full-scale strike. We said: let's act preemptively, right now, right away, without waiting for the strike to happen. We said: let's act in relation to the preparation of the strike as if it had happened. So that the aggressor feels the painful consequences in advance - before he does the irreparable and starts a brutal war. But... But... But..., You know how things turned out. When there are no preventive actions, there is only one thing left - to react. And this is always a less strong position. Because when you act preventively, you are automatically the leader of the situation, you determine its development. And when you are forced to react, you still have to fight for leadership. You must first win the initiative, and then you can work for success. Your success., And now we are at the same critical moment that was on the eve of a full-scale invasion. This is the moment for preventive actions., Russia started talking about nuclear weapons. Russian propagandists are saying even louder than before that strikes and annexations are waiting not only for our state, but also for others - from Kazakhstan to the Baltic countries, from Georgia to Moldova and Poland., The Russian President says again - and very frankly, by the way - that he wants to undermine the grain export initiative, on which the food security of tens of millions of people depends., Look at the situation with nuclear facilities in Ukraine. For the first time in history, a nuclear power plant was directly fired at from tanks. For the first time in history, cruise missiles were struck on the territory of the nuclear power plant., Why is Russia doing all this? It sees a lack of prevention in the world., Russia must feel devastating consequences already now. For the very fact of such threats, the very fact of such rhetoric. Only preventive actions can show that the world will not ""swallow"" anything and that the aggressor will have to pay a severe price for all this., To do it now, to act preemptively, is to prevent catastrophic damage. To react when the Russian strikes have already happened, is to receive damage and find yourself at a new level of escalation., These days, Russia hopes to announce a new annexation of the occupied territories of Ukraine. This has been in preparation for a long time, this has been obvious for a long time. We see these sham referenda in those territories that Russia wants to ""devour"". And we know that the mobilization in Russia was announced on the eve of this new criminal annexation not by chance. The goal is obvious - the occupier wants to take the residents of the occupied territory into the army. Either you are killed, or you kill - Russia wants to force hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians in the occupied lands to make such a choice., And there is no preventive sanctions strike that would show Russia that it will not be able to ""devour"" any part of Ukraine., When there is such a lack of preventive measures, when leadership is manifested afterwards - in response, in adaptation to the negative consequences of certain actions of Russia, this leads to a loss of time, a loss of opportunities. It makes the path to peace longer., Leadership and peace are two things that are directly related. The fact is that we have become leaders in the war. We were all forced to become leaders in the war - in the fight against the evil that started this war., We have achieved an unprecedented unification of the free world. And by the way, I want to thank the United States of America and President Biden, all our American friends for their contribution to this unification. This is an invaluable contribution., Second, millions of Ukrainians demonstrate unprecedented personal leadership every day. Think of only one number - 30 thousand. Almost as many Ukrainian warriors have already been awarded state awards for bravery over these six months. But it is not only about our warriors., For Ukraine, this is a people's war. Millions of people stood up to defend freedom, to defend independence., These are children who support the military: they raise money for defense, write letters to the front and even just carry water to our men at checkpoints., These are thousands of volunteers. These are our heroic doctors and nurses. They carry out surgeries under shelling, help deliver babies in bomb shelters, help those who were crippled by Russian strikes., I can cite many examples when the personal leadership of one or another person now - from the presidents of the countries that support us to the ordinary people who expel the invaders from Ukraine - is a component of our common leadership in the war and a part of our future victory., But we must learn to be leaders in peace! We have to draw the main conclusion now.
 Prevention is a basic thing. This is something that can do the most to maintain peace., This is what can stop aggression faster. This is what can save more lives than any response to a disaster that has already occurred. And this is what can maintain peace for a long time, when the principle of prevention is laid as the basis of the post-war architecture of security guarantees., This is precisely our Ukrainian view of leadership, security, and peacekeeping. This is something that can and should work. This is what we call for. What we put as the basis of specific draft solutions., Leadership without prevention is not complete. Without the ability to act in advance. Without the ability to hit when you see that you are about to be hit. Even the best teamwork post hoc does not give you the opportunities you have when you know how to use the moment for preventive actions. When you know how to act first., The free world is definitely stronger than any aggressors and terrorists. The free world will definitely prevail in this confrontation with Russia. We will be able to restore peace - I have no doubt about it. But the answer to the question of when this will happen depends on the answer to the question of how often we will act first., I thank you for your attention!, Thank you for supporting Ukraine! And I sincerely wish all of you to be leaders in the field that you have chosen for yourself or about to choose., Glory to Ukraine!"
27 September 2022  - 23:56 ,The only rational response to the audacity of the Russian Federation is even more support for Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Ukrainians!, I have just taken part in a meeting of the UN Security Council. This is a special meeting convened at our initiative. I am grateful to all partners who supported the convening of this meeting and clearly spoke in defense of Ukraine and international law., Fundamental norms of international law! The crime of aggression against our state, the farce in the occupied territory, which the occupiers call referenda, the preparation of another attempt to annex Ukrainian territory - all these are steps Russia is taking to finish off the UN Charter., I called on the members of the Security Council to stop the one who sets himself against everyone in the world. It is possible. It is possible right now, when the final destructive steps have not yet been taken., I emphasized at the Security Council meeting: Russia's implementation of the so-called Crimean scenario and another attempt to annex Ukrainian territory will mean that there is nothing to talk about with this President of Russia. This is clear and obvious., None of Russia’s criminal actions will change anything for Ukraine., We recognize the UN Charter, we recognize the basic principles of coexistence of peoples. And we will continue to act in order to protect normal life in Ukraine, in Europe, and in the world., We will act to protect our people in the Kherson region, in the Zaporizhzhia region, in Donbas, in the currently occupied areas of the Kharkiv region, and in Crimea., This farce in the occupied territory cannot even be called an imitation of referenda., We knew in advance what would be drawn instead of the result. Even intelligence didn't have to work very hard. The agreed figures for this farce were thrown into the media. Russia is not even hiding., The only rational response to such audacity of the occupier is even more support for Ukraine. And I am thankful to our partners who confirm such support: defense, financial, sanctions., I spoke today with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. I thanked him for his firm condemnation of the Russian sham referenda. The situation on the frontline and further support for the Armed Forces of Ukraine by the Alliance members were discussed in detail., Every new Russian strike on Ukrainian cities and our civilian objects proves that the existing defense support for Ukraine is not enough. We make this clear to our partners. And they hear us. And this is important., Today in Kyiv, I held talks with the Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France. France is making significant efforts to really help our country and to solve the crises created by Russia. The situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP was discussed in detail with the minister. Our defense needs were discussed in detail. We also discussed in detail our joint reaction to each further provocative step by Russia with sham referenda., Today in Moscow, yet another false statement was made regarding a very important achievement of Ukraine and our partners - the restoration of our seaborne grain export. It is obvious that Russia is preparing the ground for an attempt to disrupt the grain initiative. We inform partners about this., Export statistics is crystal clear and available to everyone in the international community., More than 5 million tons of agricultural products were exported from our three ports. 232 vessels departed. If we take only African countries, our agricultural products have already been exported to Algeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia., It is necessary to act immediately so that Russia does not again put these and other countries in the conditions of a food crisis., And I am grateful to everyone who opposes the Russian destabilization policy! I am grateful to everyone who helps protect our state!, As for the frontline, I will say it briefly and for now without details, although they will be good: we are moving forward and liberating our land., Glory to Ukraine!"
27 September 2022  - 23:22 ,Speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the meeting of the UN Security Council convened at the initiative of Ukraine,", Dear Ladies and Gentlemen!, Dear members of the UN Security Council who respect and adhere to the UN Charter!, Dear representatives of states and leaders who are listening to me now!, The UN Security Council is an institution that functions according to well-known and defined rules - according to the regulations, which are still observed even by the representatives of Russia., So far they do not use weapons instead of words in this hall and do not knock their neighbors' seats out. But surely no one will be surprised if this hall of the UN Security Council is also turned into a zone of violence by representatives of Russia., , Russia already despises the UN Charter. Russia already breaks any rules of this world. So it's only a matter of time before it destroys this last international institution that can still act. It can!, I urge you to act now. Anyone in the world can now name hundreds of examples of how Russia violates the international legal order and destroys the body of international law. It constantly provokes escalation and constantly responds to any proposals for talks with new brutality on the battlefield, even greater crises and threats to Ukraine and the world. And these are obvious things., I will name only five, just what is happening right now., First, Russia ignored the IAEA's call for the immediate de-occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the cessation of any hostilities against any nuclear facilities of Ukraine. This fact once again proves that Russia is deliberately keeping the world on the verge of a radiation disaster., The second is nuclear blackmail. Threats to use nuclear weapons have become a constant narrative of Russian officials and propagandists. This proves that Russia has no right to possess nuclear weapons, as it is not capable, simply not capable of guaranteeing the safety of the world even against the threat of using nuclear weapons., Third, last week I presented the Ukrainian peace formula at the UN General Assembly. Russia's response to this real path to peace was the announcement of mobilization., Moreover, Russia deliberately focuses its mobilization on the indigenous peoples of the territories it controls. And these are not only the territories of the Caucasus or Siberia, where everything is being done to mobilize as many men as possible from indigenous peoples. This is also Crimea, Ukrainian Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014., Among all the ethnic groups of Crimea, it was the men of the indigenous people - the Crimean Tatars - who received the most Russian mobilization letters in proportion to the total number., This is an outright policy of genocide!, , Fourth, before the eyes of the whole world, Russia is conducting an outright farce called a ""referendum"" on the occupied territory of Ukraine. Under the guns people are forced to fill out some papers - for a TV picture. The figures of the alleged results of the sham referendum were drawn in advance. Just as the compulsory issuance of passports to the population of the occupied territories was held in advance. And what is it for? The answer is in the next point., The fifth is the annexation of seized territories. The most brutal violation of the UN Charter. This is an attempt to steal the territory of another state. This is an attempt to erase the norms of international law. And this is a very cynical attempt to forcibly mobilize men in the occupied territory of Ukraine into the Russian army in order to send them to fight against their own homeland!, There is only one way to stop all this., First – complete isolation of Russia in response to everything it does., A state that is implementing a policy of genocide right now, keeping the world one step away from a radiation disaster, and at the same time threatening nuclear strikes cannot remain a permanent member of the UN Security Council with veto power., Russia must be excluded from all international organizations. If such exclusion is complicated by the procedure, its participation must be suspended., Second – new and tough global sanctions against Russia are needed. Any annexation in the modern world is simultaneously a crime against all states that consider the inviolability of borders vital for themselves., Third – any Russian criminal actions do not change anything for us. We do not give in to the blackmail of terrorists. It is in Ukraine and in this war that not only our independence is being defended, not only the right to life for our people, but also international law as such., Ukraine must receive all the necessary defense and financial aid so that the aggressor loses., Fourth – Ukraine must receive clear and legally binding guarantees of collective security. Since it is the independence of our country that is of such fundamental importance for many elements of global security, the world needs a corresponding security architecture., And fifth – very important. I want everyone to understand this., Russia's recognition of these sham referenda as allegedly normal, implementation of the so-called “Crimean scenario” and another attempt to annex the territory of Ukraine will mean that there is nothing to talk about with this President of Russia. Annexation is the kind of move that pits him alone against the whole of humanity., Such a clear signal is now needed from every country in the world., I believe in your ability to act!, I am very grateful to the French Presidency for the opportunity to participate in this meeting., Thank you all for your attention!, Glory to Ukraine!"
26 September 2022  - 22:41 ,"Russia felt that it will lose and is now trying to delay this moment, to ensure some activity at the front - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, I held another meeting of the Staff today. The main focus is on the operational situation on the frontline. We heard the report by the Commander-in-Chief, commanders, head of intelligence, Minister of Defense. We discussed the use of new weapons by the occupiers, in particular, Iranian drones., We are constantly working to provide our warriors with weapons and ammunition. All active actions of the Ukrainian military must be synchronized with the use of high-precision weapons. This is one of the basic priorities., The situation is particularly tough in the Donetsk region. We are doing everything to curb enemy activity. This is where our number one goal is right now, as Donbas is still the number one goal for the occupiers., Despite the obvious senselessness of the war for Russia and the occupiers' loss of initiative, the command of the Russian military still drives them to their death. Constant attempts of the Russian offensive in the Donetsk region will surely go down in the history of wars as one of the most cynical murders of one’s own soldiers. When we see this, when we see these offensives, we are once again convinced that the Russian mobilization is a frank attempt to give commanders on the ground a constant stream of ""cannon fodder."" There is simply no other point in the Russian mobilization., They felt that they will lose, and they are simply trying to delay this moment, to ensure at least some activity at the front, to replace the dead with at least someone with weapons in their hands., Unfortunately, Russian society is not yet aware of all the brutality of the Russian government towards its own people. But we must do everything so that every citizen of Russia recognizes that his own state is depriving him of the most important thing - the right to life., I spoke today with Mark Rutte, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands. In particular about the criminal mobilization that Russia is carrying out in the occupied territory, trying to throw our citizens to death under the Russian flag. We also talked about sham referenda - the world's reaction to them and to any further steps taken by the occupiers will be tough., I am thankful to the Prime Minister for his clear support and willingness to increase sanction pressure on Russia. We coordinated our steps in international organizations, discussed defense cooperation., I held a meeting with the head of our Government, Denys Shmyhal. We summarized the results of our international activity in September, the results of contacts with partners., No matter how difficult it is, the state fulfills all its social obligations. We are carrying out work as part of Fast Recovery, returning normal life to the territory liberated from the occupiers. We are taking the necessary steps in preparation for the winter period., I took part in the launch of a special investment fund to support our Ukrainian entrepreneurs and export-oriented companies. The fund has already attracted 125 million dollars, and the amount will be doubled. The most esteemed Western funds, banks and institutions have invested in this fund, Horizon Capital Growth - that's what it's called., I am grateful to everyone who prepared and implemented this investment project. And I believe that it can become a special signal for investors - a signal that it is possible and necessary to invest in the Ukrainian economy already now, as we are on the path to our victory., An important political and diplomatic event took place in the Office today. A project on the establishment of a Special International Tribunal to punish Russia for the crime of aggression against our state was presented to the ambassadors of thirty states - our partners., The difficulty of prosecuting Russia for this crime is that the existing international legal instruments are not enough. What is needed is a Special International Tribunal. And we are working on this project in great detail and meticulously. I have no doubt - the Tribunal will take place. Everyone who unleashed this criminal war against Ukraine and freedom in Europe will be brought to account., I thank everyone who defends our country! Today I especially want to celebrate the warriors who are defending Ukraine now in the Donetsk region. Warriors of the 93rd separate mechanized brigade ""Kholodnyi Yar"" and the 10th separate mountain assault brigade - for heroic defense in the Bakhmut direction. And I also want to praise the warriors of the 80th airborne assault brigade for their decisive and competent actions during the liberation of our territory. Thank you guys!, A total of 2135 warriors of these three brigades have already been awarded state awards., Eternal glory to all those who gain victory for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
25 September 2022  - 23:25 ,"Criminal mobilization is used by Russia not only to prolong the suffering of Ukrainians, but also to exterminate representatives of indigenous peoples - address by the President of Ukraine",", Ukrainians!, Today we have great news. Maryana Mamonova, a combat medic, defender of Azovstal whom we freed from Russian captivity gave birth to a daughter. I sincerely congratulate Maryana from the bottom of my heart and wish the girls only the best - peace and victory., This is another proof that life always triumphs over any evil. And evil under the Russian flag is no exception to this rule., Now all our state structures, which are needed, are fully working to help our released warriors. Medical aid, social, legal... Treatment, rehabilitation, restoration of documents, bank cards, housing, etc., Rustem Umerov, pursuant to my instruction, visited our commanders from ""Azovstal"" in Turkey today. He checked their living conditions - the conditions are comfortable. The boys are provided with everything they need. Rustem controls that. Soon we will ensure that the boys meet their relatives and friends., This week, on Tuesday, I am to receive a clear plan for each of those released - how their normal lives will be restored. Just as the process of releasing our heroes from captivity, this process of normalization is managed by Andriy Yermak, Head of the Office. He is also assisted by Kyrylo Budanov, Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, as well as our ombudsman, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Security Service, etc., I would like to emphasize: work is ongoing regarding the next exchanges. No matter how difficult it may be, we must free all our people, all Ukrainians. We do not forget about anyone., But we should still remember: it is not easy, it requires the efforts of many people, and it is directly related to the situation on the frontline. Our active actions include, in particular, the increase of those whom we can exchange. The more Russian soldiers are detained by Ukrainian forces, the faster we will be able to free our warriors, our heroes from Russian captivity., Fierce fighting takes place in many sections of the front with a total length of more than 2,000 kilometers. This is the Donetsk region, this is our Kharkiv region, Kherson region, as well as Mykolaiv and Zaporizhia regions. We have positive results in several directions., And no matter what happens this week in Russia, no matter what steps the terrorist state plans - political or military - the tasks of our state, the tasks of Ukraine, cannot change: we are fighting for life and freedom for all Ukrainians., This week there will be a new wave of our diplomatic activity. My new appeals to the political, business and student communities abroad. Our needs, our positions, our view on how to stop Russian evil will be heard everywhere in the world, absolutely everywhere., We will also make a special emphasis. Emphasis on the fact that criminal mobilization is used by Russia not only to prolong the suffering of people in Ukraine and to further destabilize the world, but also to physically exterminate men - representatives of indigenous peoples who live in the territories controlled so far, temporarily, by the Russian Federation., The situation in the occupied Crimea is catastrophic. The information about the Crimean Tatar people is fully confirmed: most of the mobilization letters are given there specifically to qırımlılar. This is another element of Russia's policy of genocide, another reason for the immediate and tough reaction of the whole world., The same is happening on the territory of Russia itself. This is a deliberate imperial policy. This is a blow to the peoples of, for example, Dagestan and the entire Caucasus, to the indigenous peoples of Siberia and other territories., And I want to repeat it once again., Again in Russian, specially for Russian ""comrades""., And this is not a kind of collection of peoples in Russia, not badges or flags somewhere on the map, no. These are not candy wrappers - these are real people., And only now you are beginning to hear it, yet still not everywhere., We see that people, in particular, in Dagestan, began to fight for their lives. We see that they are beginning to understand that this is a question of their lives. Why should their husbands, brothers, sons die in this war? In a war that one man wants. In a war against our people, on our land. He does not send his children to war., Fight to ensure that your children are not sent to die - everyone who can be taken by this criminal Russian mobilization. Because if you come to take the lives of our children - I will tell you as a father - we will not let you go alive., I want to emphasize once again: there is a way out. Do not submit to criminal mobilization. Flee. Or surrender to Ukrainian captivity at the first opportunity. I urge all our friends in the information field to spread this appeal. The more citizens of the Russian Federation at least try to protect their own lives, the sooner this criminal war of Russia against the people of Ukraine will end., I am thankful to everyone who fights and works for our victory! A difficult week is ahead. A difficult path. Difficult challenges. But ahead is our victory. And it is inevitable., This evening, I want to congratulate the Ukrainian Jewish community and all the Jews of the world on Rosh Hashanah. May all prayers for victory, all prayers for peace for Ukraine be heard., Keep defending Ukraine!, Keep defending life!, Glory to Ukraine!"
24 September 2022  - 21:59 ,The heroism and grit of our warriors leave no doubt that Ukraine will prevail - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Ukrainians!, Today, I signed the decree awarding the title of Hero of Ukraine to Serhiy Sova. A fighter of the glorious 93rd mechanized brigade ""Kholodnyi Yar"". He has defended our state - Ukraine since the beginning of the war in 2014, fought for Pisky, for the Donetsk airport. After February 24, he fought in the Kharkiv region., Serhiy Sova gave his life for Ukraine. We've all seen the photo of his hand with blue and yellow bracelets on his wrist. He has worn them as a talisman since 2014. And this photo was one of the first from Izyum, from the mass burial site in the forest that was discovered when the occupiers fled. He was a true warrior and a father that one can be proud of. Eternal memory and honor to the hero!, Eternal glory to all our warriors who gave their lives in battles for our state!, Today I awarded the honorary award ""For Courage and Bravery"" to three of our brigades. The 1st separate tank Siversk brigade, the 40th separate artillery brigade, the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade., Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Russia, the fighters of the 1st separate tank brigade have performed their tasks with dignity and courage. First in the Chernihiv region, and now in the hottest spots of the south and east of our country. In six months, more than a thousand warriors of this brigade were awarded state awards., Units of the 40th separate artillery brigade defend the state in the Kharkiv direction and do it very bravely and effectively. The proven losses of the Russian army from the fire of this brigade of ours make it clear to all the occupiers that there will be no place for the enemy on our land., This month, the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade achieved good results in the south of our country, liberating a number of settlements in the Kherson region. During the period of the full-scale invasion of Russia, three warriors in the 57th brigade were already awarded the ""Gold Star"" Order and 275 servicemen received state awards., By the way, since the establishment of such an award for our military units - and it was established in May of this year - 46 military units have already been awarded for courage and bravery. Of them, 38 military units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, four military units of the State Border Service, four military units of the National Guard. I am grateful to all of you, guys! Well done!, The heroism and grit of our warriors, the striving for independence and justice, which united all our people, do not leave a single doubt that Ukraine will prevail and that all invaders on our territory will definitely be defeated. Unless they run away. Indeed, it is true., Once again I want to say to Russians in Russian., It was no coincidence that the criminal mobilization declared by Russia was immediately called a “mobilization to graves” by the citizens of Russia themselves. Mobilization to graves. The Russian authorities are well aware that they are sending their citizens to death - there are no other options., Russian commanders do not care about the lives of Russians - they just need to replenish the empty spaces left by the dead, wounded, those who fled or the Russian soldiers that were captured., Your government does not care who will take these places. Either young IT specialists who did not serve at all, or pensioners who served only in the Soviet army. So, the key moment has come for you: right now it is being decided whether your life will end or not. , It is better not to take a conscription letter than to die in a foreign land as a war criminal. , It is better to run away from criminal mobilization than to be crippled and then bear responsibility in the court for participating in the war of aggression. , It is better to surrender to Ukrainian captivity than to be killed by the strikes of our weapons, absolutely fair strikes, as Ukraine defends itself in this war. We defend the brightest - we defend our lives, our children, our freedom., What is Russia fighting for? Every citizen of Russia knows - even if many do not admit it, they know for sure - that it is Russia that brings evil., Ukraine guarantees every Russian soldier who surrenders three things. First, you will be treated in a civilized manner, in accordance with all conventions. Second, no one will know the circumstances of your surrender, no one in Russia will know that your surrender was voluntary. And third, if you are afraid to return to Russia and do not want an exchange, we will find a way to ensure this as well., Ukraine will do everything for its victory. And every citizen of Russia should understand: no tricks will help the occupier. I promise you that., We will retaliate against every strike of the aggressor - at Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Nikopol, Donbas, at all our cities and regions... We will definitely liberate our entire country - from Kherson to the Luhansk region, from Crimea, I emphasize that, to the Donetsk region., We will not allow the occupier to go unpunished. Every murderer and torturer will be brought to justice for what he did against us, Ukrainians., Eternal glory to all our heroes!, Glory to our indomitable people!, Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for our homeland - for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
23 September 2022  - 23:14 ,"Ukraine has shown that the truth, strength, initiative and confidence in victory are on our side - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Ukrainians!, Today, the events in New York in the framework of our state's participation in the session of the UN General Assembly are coming to an end., It was a productive week for Ukraine. Many different activities – with my participation, with the participation of the First Lady of Ukraine, with the participation of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs., Ukraine has shown that not only the truth, but also strength, initiative and confidence in victory are on our side. The world is always sensitive to such things. Who is really strong, and who pretends to be strong. Who really feels his strength, and who tries his best to conceal weakness and insecurity., At the General Assembly, Ukraine proposed a formula of peace, its way to the stabilization of international relations. And it was definitely heard by the world. The reaction to my speech at the General Assembly was really positive., Different countries equally wanted to hear specifics. Specifics on how to restore peace, how to end this war. Ukraine presented its vision. Clear, logical, fair and realistic., Five points. The first: punishment for the aggressor. The second: protection of life, that is, all the necessary assistance to our state in defense. The third point: restoration of security and territorial integrity. The fourth point: security guarantees. And the fifth: the determination to achieve all this together with us – the determination of the world majority., And what did Russia present? Once again, lame excuses, complaints and constant lying propaganda, which the world has got tired of long ago, but Russian representatives still repeat it. A striking contrast with us., I am grateful to all the heads of state, all the politicians, public figures, cultural and business leaders who expressed their support for us at the General Assembly and at all the events in America this week., In particular, I participated in a special meeting on food security. This is one of the key topics in the UN this year – it was Russian aggression that made it so urgent. The world is looking for means to protect people from hunger and price crisis, and Ukraine has something to offer. We constantly increase food exports, we help the UN Food Program, we send grain as humanitarian aid to the countries that need it – Ethiopia, Somalia. And Ukraine has never ever provoked any crisis in the food market. The world appreciates all this., Due to the decency of Ukraine and the constructive desire of our state to help others, we have a unique result: Russian propaganda is losing its influence even in the world where we still have to secure a strong information position, in particular in the countries of the Global South. These are Latin America, Africa, South Asia., Also this week I participated in several important formats of communication with investors. The summit under the auspices of Forbes – a meeting of the world's largest businessmen engaged in philanthropy. Video conference with representatives of BlackRock and Goldman Sachs – important global players. Clinton Global Initiative. Each such event adds attention to Ukraine, adds specific projects and benefits to our state, strengthens our resilience, and brings our victory closer., The First Lady of Ukraine met in New York with Liz Truss, the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and it was a very substantive meeting. With First Lady of France Brigitte Macron. Together with Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, she met with António Guterres, the UN Secretary-General. In total, she held almost 20 meetings., At the invitation of Charles Michel, Olena took part in the Women in Conflict forum, which took place within the General Assembly. She presented a special charity fund - the Olena Zelenska Foundation, in order to accumulate even more support for Ukrainians, specifically for the humanitarian direction - primarily education, medicine and the restoration of what was destroyed by Russian strikes. We are creating all the necessary institutional framework so that anyone in the world can help us as efficiently, quickly and reliably as possible., The Prime Minister of Ukraine held dozens of high-level meetings. Accents are clear. The situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. The expansion of defense, financial and sanction support. Support in preparing our country for winter, support in reconstruction. During each meeting, there was an emphasis that Russian terror must receive a clear global response - military, economic and legal, including the recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism., Our proposals for security guarantees for Ukraine, for Europe and the world - a project developed by the Yermak-Rasmussen group - were outlined in New York. Denys Shmyhal also met with the heads of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other major financial and investment organizations of the world. I am grateful to all of them for their support!, It is important to note the negotiations with the Prime Minister of Japan, the country that will soon chair the G7 and the UN Security Council. We discussed our priorities. Negotiations took place with the Prime Minister of Iraq - this is a new partner for Ukraine, an important partner., The Minister of Foreign Affairs held more than 30 meetings, and the vast majority of them were with representatives of countries that are not our traditional partners. We are strengthening our position in relations with Africa, Asia and Latin America., Probably, this is the most meaningful and positive participation of Ukraine in the UN General Assembly in all years of our independence. The world not only talks about Ukraine, but also realizes that by helping Ukraine, it also helps solve urgent global problems and crises. We offer a way to make the world more stable and safer. The world heard it., A very important event took place today in Izyum, Kharkiv region. Representatives of almost twenty diplomatic missions - the Baltic states and Eastern Europe, Germany, France, Spain, Slovenia, Croatia, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Türkiye, the EU Ambassador - saw with their own eyes what the Russian occupiers left behind. Ruined houses, torture chambers, mass burial site... The world will know full information about every crime committed by Russia in the temporarily occupied territories., The world will react absolutely justly to the sham referenda - they will be unequivocally condemned, and to the criminal mobilization that the occupiers are currently trying to carry out in Crimea and other parts of Ukraine, which they so far control. These are not just crimes against international law and the law of Ukraine. These are crimes against specific people, against the nation., Now in Crimea, in places of dense residence of qırımlılar, there are attempts to find and mobilize as many men as possible. We already have evidence of this. This is a deliberate attempt by Russia to destroy the Crimean Tatar people, this is a deliberate attempt by the aggressor state to take the lives of as many residents of the territory the Russian troops invaded as possible., I have a simple request to all our people in the temporarily occupied territory: do the main thing – save your lives and help us weaken and destroy the occupiers., Hide from the Russian mobilization by any means. Avoid conscription letters. Try to get to the free territory of Ukraine., But if you get into the Russian army, sabotage any activity of the enemy, hinder any Russian operations, provide us with any important information about the occupiers – their bases, headquarters, warehouses with ammunition. And at the first opportunity, switch to our positions. Do everything to save your life and help liberate Ukraine., Since the beginning of active actions in the east of our country in September, about 9 thousand square kilometers of territory and about 400 settlements have already been liberated. This tangible result was achieved in particular thanks to the fact that our people in the temporarily occupied territory helped us. Please do everything to increase such help., Give our special services all the information about those who organize and help conduct this farce with sham referenda. Provide all information about the Russian mobilization, about the Russian army in general. Help those in the occupied areas who need it: elderly people, single people, families with children. Ukraine will return to all its lands, and we must save as many of our people there as possible., Pursuant to my instruction, Head of the Office Andriy Yermak held a meeting today regarding assistance to Ukrainians whom we have freed from captivity. The Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, the Head of the National Guard, the ministers of internal affairs, defense, healthcare, social policy, representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our ombudsman were present. Our warriors must receive everything the necessary, real help, any assistance. The state knows how to be grateful to its heroes. I am waiting for a report at the beginning of the week with a specific plan on supporting each person., Today, the Russian army used Iranian drones for attacking the Dnipropetrovsk region and Odesa. I commissioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide a tough response to this fact. The world will know about every fact of collaboration with evil, and it will have corresponding consequences., It has already been decided to deprive the Ambassador of Iran to Ukraine of accreditation, as well as to significantly reduce the number of diplomatic personnel of the Iranian Embassy., Six of these Iranian drones were shot down by our anti-aircraft troops of the ""East"" and ""South"" air commands. Another one was shot down by the anti-aircraft defense of the Naval Forces. In addition, the “Center” air command shot down a Russian strike aircraft and a helicopter today in the south of our country. And I was just informed about another Iranian combat drone shot down by the anti-aircraft troops of the ""South"" command., I am grateful to our warriors for accuracy!, I am grateful to everyone who fights and works for the victory of Ukraine!, I am grateful to everyone in the world who helps us protect life and freedom!, Glory to Ukraine!"
23 September 2022  - 14:46 ,"To give hope for the future, and to give people the feeling that they are respected - this is why the First Lady of Ukraine created the Foundation - President's speech at the presentation of the Olena Zelenska Foundation",", Dear Friends!, Ladies and Gentlemen! , Dear Olena!, Even if I am not with you now, I know that our unity does not stop for a minute. This unity is our most powerful force that help us make anything possible. And the most important that we made possible to provide reliable protection of freedom., You know… Every short question “What is freedom?” does not have a universal short answer. It is one of those questions, which will bring up many new answers as long as humankind lives. But there is one element which makes incomplete any answer to the question about freedom. This element is respect for a person. For a person of any age, property status, religion, race, gender., Respect is what free society is based on. , Respect is the source of democracy. , Respect is what every wise father, every wise mother teach their children. , Respect is clearly displayed in the life of any country. Respect is education. It is medicine. It is help for those, who find themselves in a difficult life situation, and for those, who cannot support themselves and their children. Respect is institutions that provide justice. It is cultural institutions that keep the heritage of every community, every nation and whole humanity. When all this works, when there is respect, then any person can really enjoy freedom., So it's no surprise, when the enemy of freedom destroys infrastructure of respect – everything that provides humanitarian welfare., Twenty five hundred educational facilities in Ukraine were destroyed by Russian strikes – schools, universities, educational clubs and others. More than thousand medical facilities were destroyed by Russian missiles and shelling. Tens of thousands of houses were simply burned down. Millions of people became displaced persons., Russia has caused a humanitarian disaster in Ukraine because it hates freedom. And that is why the world supported our call for unity. The world sees what Russia attacks and what Ukraine defends. We protect freedom, we protect people and do everything, so that as many friends of freedom around the world as possible can contribute to this struggle. , That is why the First Lady of Ukraine set up this foundation – Olena Zelenska Foundation. She chose the humanitarian dimension, and there are huge challenges in this dimension. To restore what has been destroyed, to help those who need protection, to give hope for the future, and to give people the feeling that they are respected. , This is an extremely noble cause, and I encourage all of you to join in – people, companies, foundations., Ukraine knows how to be grateful!, Thank you everyone who supports us!, Thank you everyone who supports Olena Zelenska Foundation!, Thank you, friends of freedom!, Glory to Ukraine!"
23 September 2022  - 10:02 ,"The more added value Ukraine produces, the more added security the people of the world get – speech by the President of Ukraine at the Forbes 400 Summit on Philanthropy",", Ladies and Gentlemen! Friends! , Thank you for the invitation to participate in this summit., I am sure that today many wise words will be said about charity – about the experience of philanthropy and opportunities to help., Therefore, I do not want to waste your time now on what others may say., I want to draw your attention to one detail, which I think is very important – to the experience that Ukraine has acquired and that others can acquire - together with us, together with Ukraine., Ukraine is currently the only place on earth that very organically combines investment and philanthropy., In Ukraine, you can be an investor and, as a result, a de facto philanthropist in relation to others, you can even be just a businessman, and such quite ordinary economic activity is transformed into a real good help for hundreds of millions or even billions of people., Just look at how much the world depends on the supply of agricultural products from Ukraine to the global market. For subjects of the agricultural sector in Ukraine, for businessmen and farmers, this is business and this is work, this is the economy. But as a result, it is the right to food for hundreds of millions of people in the countries of Africa, Asia and Europe., We are currently sending agricultural products to Ethiopia, Somalia, Yemen, Lebanon and other countries. This is a real lifesaver., But how much depends on logistics!, When Russia blocked our seaports, exports decreased significantly. Because grain, sunflower and other agricultural raw materials are such a cargo, the supply logistics of which is very, very difficult to rebuild. Large volumes can now be delivered primarily by sea. We need more investment in the expansion of export technologies., For example, we are preparing the construction of a pipeline with Poland for the export of sunflower oil. This is a pilot. A specific project, which is the economy for us, and for the global food market, it is an element of stability, an element of security., By investing in agro-processing in Ukraine and in the construction of food storage facilities, it is possible to expand not only the logistical possibilities for the supply of agricultural products, but also the range of goods that can be supplied., The more added value Ukraine produces, the more added security the people of the world get., Look at what the production of electricity in Ukraine means. On the one hand, it is business. Quite a profitable business - in particular, in the field of green energy production. But given our ability to export electricity, this is not just business – this is a real tool to prevent energy poverty for tens of millions of people in the countries of Europe with which we border. This is the stabilization of the energy situation on the entire European continent., We are approached by Moldova, Romania, Poland, and other neighbors to help them with electricity in the winter. And we are ready to help. And that is why investments in the expansion of our energy capacities are a salvation from the cold for various peoples., Moreover! Ukraine's ability to export tens of gigawatts of electricity is an important factor in European climate policy. Currently, Europe, unfortunately, is still heavily dependent on Russia's dirty energy resources. They are dirty not only because their sale is Russia's way of financing the war. Not only because their burning pollutes the atmosphere. But also because they are extracted so brutally and carelessly in relation to the environment that their extraction in Russia is synonymous with ecological disaster., Ukrainian electricity can help replace dirty Russian energy resources. And therefore, this is climate security., We also have tremendous opportunities in the development of hydrogen energy and transportation of green hydrogen to Europe. The sun, wind, nuclear energy, green hydrogen - all this is in Ukraine, and it's not just billions of dollars that can be invested and earned, but billions of dollars that will work to help different countries and peoples - tens of millions of people., New green clean energy requires lithium, graphite and other rare earth metals. We have enough of them. Therefore, by investing in Ukraine, one can accelerate the development of green energy in other countries as well., We generate tens of millions of cubic meters of wood annually. At the same time, we ensure the restoration of forests. Investing in the production of ecological products from wood and cellulose in Ukraine is a way to reduce the world's use of petroleum products and plastic, and it is part of the joint protection of our nature., Another example is that the whole world needs fertilizers for food production. Why make or buy them from Russian gas? It is possible to build facilities for the production of tens of millions of tons of pure green and cheap ammonia in Ukraine. You can make money from this and help not only food security, but also peace - peace on our planet., Ukraine has never waged illegal wars. We are not aggressors. We have never wished harm to other peoples. We have never made geopolitics a means of conquering someone else. Why is this important?, When any economic player works with us, it means that the economic potential that he creates with his business helps realize only peace, only peaceful goals., For example, if any company now works in Russia, it indirectly helps evil - at least it pays taxes to the budget of the aggressor state, that is, it supports their economy, which serves terror. Or even supplies something to the Russian army, directly helping the killers., When any state gets carried away with geopolitics and becomes an aggressor, business can inevitably become an accomplice to this evil., Therefore, we are grateful to all companies and businessmen who left the Russian market., And that is why we offer all the companies and businesses of the world to come to us in Ukraine - to start a business here, to localize their production here, to work with Ukraine in order to have access to the huge markets of the European Union, Britain, Canada and other nations with which we are friends., We give priority to the development of our processing industry - its various directions. We have a special program for its development. And we offer all investors of the world to join in its implementation., This is the same process – when investments, when business, when the economy – simply by working – become philanthropy, because they can increase the potential of peace in the world and reduce the potential of aggressors., Look at the capabilities of our IT sector and industries such as drone production., Russia tried to destroy our digital resilience. But we did not allow that., Ukrainian digital potential has endured, it is very solid. Our digitization has a powerful social aspect – it is technology that really works for the welfare and protection of people. Our people have digital documents, access to digitized government services, and a high level of digitization of business., IT companies in Ukraine are profitable, and their business is both a boon for millions and an element of peace protection, if we take the context of cyber security and Russian cyber attacks., Just like, for example, the production of drones in Ukraine. For those who invest, this is the economy. And for those who then use drones - depending on their class - it's safety, it's comfort or work., Again: I don't want to take up a lot of your time and I don't want to repeat what you've probably already heard and know., But I want to emphasize this point - any significant human effort leads to a long chain of consequences. Any significant effort of a business or a businessman leads to such consequences that directly or indirectly can affect the lives of other people - can do good. And this is achieved not even simply by giving money somewhere., But also by the fact that you work morally, work consciously, conduct your business in such a way that your investments, which give you profit, simultaneously help others have a better life – safer, more satiated, more educated, healthier, wealthier., Business has this power. And I urge all of you to boldly use this power of business – to invest in such a way that it is at the same time an aid to the normal life of various peoples., I invite you all to Ukraine! Thank you for your interest and faith in Ukraine, which you definitely have, otherwise I would not have this address of mine now., I sincerely believe that we will be able to restore justice for our country and restore peace as soon as possible., Glory to Ukraine!"
22 September 2022  - 22:00 ,Russia's decision on mobilization is an admission that their regular army did not withstand and crumbled - address by the President of Ukraine,", Ukrainians!, All our defenders!, Today I want to say special words of gratitude. Gratitude to all our people who defend our state, defend independence., Ukraine held out after a full-scale attack by Russia. Ukraine managed to unite the world around the struggle for freedom. Ukraine managed to liberate a significant part of the territory the Russian troops invaded. Ukraine liberates people from Russian captivity., And Ukraine managed to change the course of the war so that every occupier, even the most inadequate one, felt that we can win and are moving towards victory., I am thankful to everyone who fights and works for this! For the sake of our victory., It is precisely to the fact of Ukrainian strength that the leadership of Russia reacts, changing tactics and trying to draw even more Russian citizens and resources into the war., Russia's decision on mobilization is a frank admission that their regular army, which has been prepared for decades to take over a foreign country, did not withstand and crumbled. And now, due to mobilization, Russia's war against Ukraine for the majority of Russian citizens is not something on TV or on the Internet, but something that has entered every Russian home., I’ve held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. The questions are clear. Frontline. Provision of our military. And new threats created by Russia., I will note right away: any decisions of the Russian leadership do not change anything for Ukraine. We should care only about our tasks. This is the liberation of our country, the protection of our people and the mobilization of global support for the implementation of our tasks., Diplomatic mobilization of the entire international community is now taking place., The circle of those who support us now is not limited to our traditional partners and those who openly supported our state after February 24. Now almost everyone supports us - this is the reaction to new Russian escalation steps., In particular, the farce with the preparation of sham referenda in the occupied territory demonstrates what happened in 2014 in Crimea and Donbas., And I am grateful to everyone in the world who supported us. Who clearly condemned another Russian lie., Grateful to President Biden and all American friends. To President Macron, Chancellor Scholz, the President of Finland and all our Polish brothers, the Baltic states, Mr. Borrell, Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, Charles Michel, the OSCE and all Europeans from Iceland to Romania, who will never be deceived by Russia again., I am thankful to Britain for the support! Türkiye! Thank you Canada! Thanks also to all those who now privately express their support for Ukraine., When Russia declares that it supposedly wants negotiations, but announces mobilization... When Russia knows Ukraine's clear position about the impossibility of a diplomatic process after Russia holds any sham referenda..., Everything is clear to everyone. Russia itself buries the prospect of negotiations with its own hands., I will explain to the Russians what is happening in Russian., Protests against mobilization took place in the cities of Russia - albeit not massive, but they took place. And they take place. And this is an indicator. Not only in Moscow and St. Petersburg. We know the real mood in the regions of Russia., We see that people in Dagestan, in Buryatia, in other national republics and regions of Russia understand that they were simply thrown. Thrown to death., Why, for example, Dagestanis or anyone else should die in the Kharkiv region or near Donetsk? Because one person in Russia decided so - for all the citizens of Russia. There is no other reason. That’s what he wants., You are already accomplices in all these crimes, murders and torture of Ukrainians., Because you were silent. Because you are silent., And now it's time for you to choose. For men in Russia, this is a choice to die or live, to become a cripple or to preserve health. For women in Russia, the choice is to lose their husbands, sons, grandchildren forever, or still try to protect them from death, from war, from one person., Just think about the number of people they want to take away!, We know for sure that the conscription letters for 300,000 people were printed and signed in advance, even before this decision on mobilization appeared. Our intelligence has proven it. But the Russian leadership is preparing to take up to a million men into the army - this is the key thing they are now silent about., We know that they will take everyone indiscriminately. Not only the military in the reserve, but any men. Anyone who will be so intimidated that he will be more afraid of avoiding war than of dying in war., 55 thousand Russian soldiers died in this war in six months. Tens of thousands are wounded and maimed. Want more? No? Then protest. Fight back. Run away. Or surrender to Ukrainian captivity. These are options for you to survive., Russian mothers! Have no doubt that the children of the top officials of your state will not be sent to the war against Ukraine. Those who make decisions in your country take care of their children. And they do not even bury your children., And we return ours., A very important briefing was held today. Head of the Office Yermak, Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Budanov, Head of the Security Service Maliuk, Minister of Internal Affairs Monastyrskyi. They told the details of our operation to release 215 warriors, the details of the exchange. We do everything so that society and the world can see how Ukraine protects people and basic human values., Once again, I congratulate 215 families and our entire country on the return of the heroes., I am thankful to everyone who helps Ukraine!, Eternal glory to all who fight for Ukraine!, Glory to our indomitable and brave people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
22 September 2022  - 02:12 ,Speech by the President of Ukraine at the General Debate of the 77th session of the UN General Assembly,", Greetings to all people of the world who value peace and unity between different and equal nations!, I wish you all peace!, I thank you that we are united in our striving to restore peace and to guarantee peace for any nation that has become a victim of the armed aggression., A crime has been committed against Ukraine, and we demand just punishment., The crime was committed against our state borders. The crime was committed against the lives of our people. The crime was committed against the dignity of our women and men. , The crime was committed against the values that make you and me a community of the united nations., And Ukraine demands punishment for trying to steal our territory. Punishment for the murders of thousands of people. Punishment for tortures and humiliations of women and men. , Punishment for the catastrophic turbulence that Russia provoked with its illegal war and not only for us, Ukrainians, but for the whole world. For every nation that is represented in this Hall of the UN General Assembly., I am speaking on behalf of the state, which is forced to defend itself, but has the formula for peace. I am speaking to everyone who wants to hear how to achieve peace. , I will present a formula that can work not only for us, but for anyone who may find themselves in similar circumstances as we did. It is a formula that punishes crime, protects life, restores security and territorial integrity, guarantees security, and provides determination. , There are five preconditions for peace., Dear Mr. President of the General Assembly!, Dear Secretary-General of the United Nations!, Dear heads of states and governments!, Dear journalists! , Nations of the world!, Ukraine wants peace. Europe wants peace. The world wants peace. And we have seen who is the only one who wants war. , There is only one Entity among all UN Member States who would say now, if he could interrupt my speech, that he is happy with this war – with his war. But we will not let this Entity prevail over us, even though it is the largest state in the world., Ukraine showed strength on the battlefield, using its right to self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter. And no one will reproach us now or in the future with weakness or inability to fight for ourselves, for our independence. , We are achieving a result in this fight and we see what the end of this war will be, and what will be the guarantees of a stable peace., The UN Charter proclaims the equality of nations – and we proved that Ukraine is equal among the equals. , The UN Charter protects the inviolability of borders – and we confirm our state borderline by expelling the occupiers outside. , The UN Charter stipulates the value of human rights, dignity and life, and we also stipulate them – with every Ukrainian city freed from Russian occupation., We did not provoke this war. We held 88 rounds of talks in various formats to prevent this war, just from the beginning of my presidency until February 24 this year., But Russia – instead of stopping the crime of aggression, which it started back in 2014 – turned it into a full-scale invasion. And we have no choice but to defend ourselves. We do it. We push the aggressor beyond the internationally recognized border of the Ukrainian state., And this is the first item of our peace formula. Comprehensive item. Punishment. , Punishment for the crime of aggression. Punishment for violation of borders and territorial integrity. Punishment that must be in place until the internationally recognized border is restored. Until the aggression stops. And until the damages and losses for the war are fully compensated., Therefore, sanctions against the aggressor are part of the peace formula. Blocking the trade and relations with the aggressor is part of the peace formula. All this is a punishment., So long as the aggressor is a party to decision-making in the international organizations, he must be isolated from them – at least until aggression lasts. Reject the right to vote. Deprive delegation rights. Remove the right of veto – if it is a Member of the UN Security Council. In order to punish the aggressor within the institutions., We should not turn a blind eye to propagandists who justify aggression, but apply a full package of personal restrictions against them. That is a punishment for lying., Citizens of the aggressor state should not be allowed to enjoy tourism or shopping in the territory of those who value peace, but should be encouraged through visa restrictions to fight against the aggression of their own state. Punish for abetting the evil., A Special Tribunal should be created to punish Russia for the crime of aggression against our state. This will become signal to all “would-be” aggressors, that they must value peace or be brought to responsibility by the world., We have prepared precise steps to establish such Tribunal. They will be presented to all states., Ukraine will appeal to the UN General Assembly to support an international compensation mechanism. , We count on your support. , Russia should pay for this war with its assets. It is also a punishment. This is one of the most terrible punishments for Russian officials, who value money above everything else., The second item of the peace formula is the protection of life. The most concrete item., Now, while the sessions of the General Assembly continue, in the Ukrainian town of Izyum, Kharkiv region, the exhumation is under way... of bodies from a mass burial, which happened when the territory was controlled by Russian troops. The bodies of women and men, children and adults, civilians and soldiers were found there. 445 graves. , There is a family that died under the rubble of a house after a Russian airstrike – father, mother, 6- and 8-year-old girls, grandparents. There is a man who was strangled with a rope. There is a woman with broken ribs and wounds on her body. There is a man who was castrated before the murder, and this is not the first case., Ask, please, the representatives of Russia why the Russian military are so obsessed with castration. What was done to them so that they want to do this to others?, The only thing that differs the mass burial in Izyum from what the world saw in Bucha is, in fact, the burial. The Russian army was in Izyum for a longer time, and therefore the bodies of the killed people were buried, and not scattered on the streets., So, how can we allow the Russian army somewhere on Ukrainian soil, knowing that they are committing such mass murders everywhere? We cannot., We must protect life. The world must protect life. Every state suffering the armed aggression needs the opportunity to protect its citizens and liberate its territory., If it requires help with weapons or shells – they should be provided. If you need financial help for this, it should be given. If for this, it is necessary to help with the intelligence data – just do it. But what is not needed is lies., We can return the Ukrainian flag to our entire territory. We can do it with the force of arms. , But we need time. , We tried to speed it up. We tried to implement the basic provisions of the UN Charter for Ukraine through negotiations. , But Russia is afraid of real negotiations and does not want to fulfill any fair international obligations. It lies to everyone. As it is typical for aggressors, for terrorists. , Even now, when Russia talks about negotiations, it only wants to slow down its retreat. Russia wants to spend the winter on the occupied territory of Ukraine and prepare forces to attempt a new offensive. New Buchas, new Izyums... Or at least it wants to prepare fortifications on occupied land and carry out military mobilization at home., We cannot agree to a delayed war. Because it will be even hotter than the war now., For us, this is a war for life. That is why we need defense support – weapons, military equipment and shells. Offensive weapons, a long-range one is enough to liberate our land, and defensive systems, above all, air defense. And we need financial support – to keep internal stability and fulfill social obligations to our people. , Physical and social protection are two elements of any nation's life. So, the second item of our peace formula is the protection of life. By all available means – allowed by the UN Charter., The third item of our peace formula is restoring security and territorial integrity. , Look at how many elements of global security Russia has undermined with its war – maritime safety, food safety, radiation safety, energy safety and safety from weapons of mass destruction., We are already restoring maritime safety and food security. And I thank Mr. António Guterres for his personal involvement. Algeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia, Bangladesh, Israel, India, Iran, Yemen, Cyprus, China, Korea, Lebanon, Türkiye, Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Germany, Romania and France have already received Ukrainian agricultural products. , And we have to increase the supply by sea. Both under market conditions and within the UN Food Program, for which Ukraine is always a reliable partner. , By the way, despite all the difficulties caused by the war, we decided to provide humanitarian aid to Ethiopia and Somalia, so we will send them an additional amount of our wheat., But it is more difficult with other security elements. , On the eve of the General Assembly meeting, Russia fired missiles at the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant. The explosion hit the station buildings – windows were broken, walls were damaged. The rockets exploded only three hundred meters from the walls of the reactors! , And this is after the IAEA's clear appeal to Russia to stop any hostile activity against any nuclear facilities of Ukraine and, in particular, against the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station – the largest one in Europe, which Russia has turned into a target. , And that makes all of you a target., Russian radiation blackmailing is something that should concern each and every one of you, because none of you will find a vaccine against radiation sickness., The cost of living crisis continues in dozens of countries, it roots in the destabilization of the energy market. It is necessary to remove the main factor of global price turbulence, namely: Russian energy blackmailing. , It is necessary to cap the prices at which Russia exports its energy resources. It is necessary to make Russian oil and gas – just ordinary goods again. Currently, oil and gas are Russia’s energy weapons. And that is why it manipulates the markets so that electricity, gas, petrol and diesel become the privilege of few instead of being a common good available to all., Limiting prices is safeguarding the world. This is the way to restore energy and price security. , But will the world go for it? Or will it be scared? Will it be scared of Russian threats?, It is necessary to take only one strong step, after which everything will become clear. The time has come for this., This step will put everything in place. After the Russian missile terror. After the massacres. After Mariupol. After the burning of Ukrainian prisoners in Olenivka by the Russian military. After blocking the ports. After the strikes of Russian tanks and missiles on nuclear power plants. And after threats to use nuclear weapons, which have become the rule, not the exception, for Russian propagandists..., We must finally recognize Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. At all levels. In all countries that confess the values of peace and protection of human life. Legally. Politically. , If you don't have a legal mechanism, you can make a political decision – in the parliaments. This is the foundation for restoring global security. If this strong step is taken, doubts will disappear – whether to take other important steps., And what is very sensitive – is the border, the territorial integrity., When one country tries to steal the territory of another state, it puts all world nations under attack. , Global security cannot be restored without restoring the territorial integrity of the nation which suffered the armed aggression., So, the third item of the Ukrainian peace formula is the restoration of security and territorial integrity. The fourth item is security guarantees., Every nation has the right to security guarantees. Not only the largest nations. Not only the most fortunate ones., We have proposals to upgrade the security architecture for Ukraine, and for Europe and the world, which will not allow any more aggression against us. We are already presenting them to partners. , Proposals for legally binding multilateral and bilateral treaties. These are the conditions for the guarantors to act, and the timeline for their actions to bring results – results on land, at sea and in the air; in diplomacy and politics, in economy and finance, in providing weapons and intelligence. Each of you, who will receive the text of our peace formula will also see the details of what we offer as security guarantees., I do not want to compare our offers with the guarantees of any alliances that exist on the planet now. I want to stress that it is always much better to guarantee the security of a nation, preventively, rather than to stop a war after it has already begun., And the fifth item of the Ukrainian peace formula is determination. Something without which the other four items will not work., This is our determination to fight. This is the determination of the partners to help us, and also themselves. And this is the determination of the world to unite around the one who fights against armed aggression and to call to order the one who threatens all., So, all five items of our formula: , This is the formula of crime and punishment, which is already well known to Russia. And this is the formula of justice and law and order that Russia has yet to learn. As well as any other potential aggressors., What is not in our formula? Neutrality., Those who speak of neutrality, when human values and peace are under attack, mean something else. They talk about indifference – everyone for themselves. Here's what they say. They pretend to be interested in each other's problems. They take care of each other formally. They sympathize only for protocol. And that is why they pretend to protect someone, but in reality they protect only their vested interests. This is what creates the conditions for war. This is what needs to be corrected in order to create conditions for peace., All you need is determination., There was a lot of talking about reforming the UN. How did it all end? No result., If you look carefully at our peace formula, you will see that its implementation is already becoming a de-facto reform of the United Nations. Our formula is universal, and unites the North and the South of the world. It calls for the world's majority, and encourages to expand the representation of those who remained unheard. , This is an imbalance when Africa, Latin America, most of Asia, Central and Eastern Europe comply with the right of veto, that they themselves never had., And this is what Ukraine is talking about. And have you ever heard such words from Russia? But it is a permanent member of the Security Council. For some reason. For what reason, not Japan or Brazil, not Türkiye or India, not Germany or Ukraine. The day will come when this will be resolved., As for the talks between Ukraine and Russia. , Probably you have happened to hear different words from Russia about the talks – as if they were ready for them. But. They talk about the talks but announce military mobilization. They talk about the talks but announce pseudo referendums in the occupied territories of Ukraine., What is true then? The military mobilization in Russia is true. Sham referendums are also true. Russia wants war. It's true. But Russia will not be able to stop the course of history. Mankind and the international law are stronger than one terrorist state. Russia will be forced to end this war. The war it has started., I rule out that the settlement can happen on a different basis than the Ukrainian peace formula. The further the Russian terror reaches, the less likely it is that anyone in the world will agree to sit at one table with them., And if my words will be followed by new Russian missiles and acts of terrorism it will only prove the weakness. Russia’s weakness. Its inability to prevail over us, its inability to prevail over the world., It will only prove that 5 items of the Ukrainian peace formula must be implemented as soon as possible. , We are ready for peace. But true, honest and fair peace. That’s why the world is on our side. , And finally. , I want to thank one hundred and one countries that voted for my video address to take place. It was a vote not only about the format. It was the vote about principles., Only seven countries voted against: Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, Eritrea, Nicaragua, Russia and Syria., Seven. Seven who are afraid of the video address. Seven who respond to principles with a red button. Only seven., One hundred and one – and seven., Friends! If this coalition is against our determination, then I congratulate you all. Because this means that peace will prevail over any aggression, and that there is no obstacle for us to implement the peace formula., I thank you for your attention!, Once again, I wish you all peace!, Glory to Ukraine!"
21 September 2022  - 02:19 ,The state that provokes famine should get the toughest reaction from the world - President's speech at the Global Food Security Summit,", Dear colleagues!, Ladies and Gentlemen!, I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this meeting., Given the meeting is taking place on the margins of the UN General Assembly, I will mention one of the fundamental documents of the modern international legal system., This is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 30 articles about the most urgent things for every person out of the billions of people who have lived, live and will live on our planet. I will now quote Article 25:, “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.”, This is a very important definition - the definition of the right, not the privilege, the right, not the fortune, the right, not the vagaries of climate. The right to food. The right to protection against hunger. The right!, Ukraine considers this right inalienable for all people, for all countries. Every person in the world should be free from hunger and even the threat of it. Every country in the world should be reliably protected from famine., And any state that provokes famine, that tries to make access to food a privilege, that tries to make the protection of nations from famine dependent on the smile of fortune or the mercy of some dictator - such a state must get the toughest reaction from the world. Reaction as for the use of weapons of mass destruction - chemical, biological or nuclear. Because the spread of famine is the same immoral and inhumane weapon of mass destruction as the spread of deadly bacteria or radiation., This is Ukraine's position. This is the position of a nation that has lost millions of people to Holodomors. Therefore, we particularly feel what the words ""food security"" really mean. What the right to protection against hunger is. What the right to food is., We feel why this is not a privilege, why it should not be an accident and why anyone who destroys this right should face a tough response., That is why we are making so much effort to restore our agricultural exports. This is not only an economic issue for us. This is a question of basic values and respect for life as such., In 8 months of last year, Ukraine exported almost 38 million tons of agricultural products. In 8 months of this year, the world market has received almost 10 million tons less already., Minus 10 million tons of our agricultural exports is plus tens of millions of people who found themselves on the brink of starvation or are starving. And these are only the initial consequences of the Russian blockade of our ports, Russian attempts with missile strikes to prevent us from building new export logistics, and the immoral political game with fluctuations in food prices., Russia must bear responsibility for this., Why did it need all this? To supposedly graciously give food in exchange for sovereignty. In exchange for political submission. In exchange for vulnerability. Vulnerability of many African, Asian and European countries., That is why Russia wants to make protection from hunger not a right, but a privilege, and wants to make food - not an inalienable right, but something to beg for., We categorically do not accept that. We consistently fight against that. Even in the conditions of a full-scale war, we help those who cannot provide agricultural products for themselves with our agricultural products. And I want to assure the UN that Ukraine will continue to be a guarantor of the UN World Food Programme., In particular, we are already helping Somalia and Ethiopia. Africa, Asia, Europe, the American continent... Wherever food is needed, we are ready to export and help., And we call for your solidarity., Stand in solidarity with us in holding Russia to account. Stand in solidarity with us in guaranteeing the right of any person and any country to protection from hunger, the right to food., This is a right, not a privilege. It should be so. I believe that we will be able to guarantee it., I am grateful to UN Secretary-General Guterres. I am grateful to Türkiye and President Erdoğan. Our grain export initiative is working steadily. And I am grateful to all Ukrainians - each and every one who turns our ability to guarantee global food security into an objective reality., I thank all of you for your support and attention!, Glory to Ukraine!"
21 September 2022  - 00:29 ,The situation on the frontline clearly indicates that the initiative belongs to Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,",  Ukrainians!, I’ve just taken part in a high-level meeting on food security. This meeting took place within the regular UN General Assembly., The topic of food security is strategically important for our country. This is where we have – and must retain – a global role. This is what gives us economic strength and strengthens our moral leadership. The leadership of people who help others even when they themselves are in extremely difficult circumstances., We participate in the implementation of the UN World Food Programme and help African countries. We have resumed our seaborne agricultural exports, and this enables us to export our agricultural products to countries already on three continents., We are working on opening the markets of Latin America and other important parts of the world for our producers., Tomorrow I will participate in the General Debate of the United Nations General Assembly. Obviously, in a video format. But no matter what the format is, the position of our state will sound, as always, clearly and strongly. Especially since the visit of the First Lady of Ukraine to the United States has already begun, meetings within the UN General Assembly have begun., Olena has already met with the First Ladies of Poland and Lithuania - this is our format of the Lublin Triangle. And she also met nine wives of presidents and prime ministers from different countries at the Ukrainian Institute of America in the framework of the Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen. This is the first such event within our cooperation format. I expect important decisions after the meetings of Prime Minister of Ukraine Shmyhal with the leaders of the states in the framework of the General Assembly., Today I spoke with the American friends of our country within the Clinton Global Initiative. And also with representatives of the leading American investment circles. I felt a great interest in Ukraine, in our reconstruction, in our capabilities. Unequivocal faith in Ukraine. Good knowledge of the situation in our country. We are developing our relations with the US at all levels., I spoke with President of Türkiye Erdoğan. The key topic is security., Head of the Office Andriy Yermak had another conversation with US President's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan today. A very useful, substantive and efficient conversation., We continue stabilization measures in the areas liberated from the Russian occupation. The regular facts of Russian atrocities are recorded - people show where the occupiers had torture chambers, where they hid the bodies of the murdered, testify about who helped the occupiers., I am thankful to all law enforcement officers involved in establishing the truth about the crimes of the occupiers. I am thankful to everyone who helps them. This is a colossal job that is needed for the sake of justice, for the sake of punishing everyone guilty of crimes against Ukrainians., The situation on the frontline clearly indicates that the initiative belongs to Ukraine. Our defenders very carefully and very bravely fulfill the tasks set by their commanders., Today, I would like to particularly note the 81st separate airborne assault brigade for its courage in liberating settlements in the Donetsk region. And also the 93rd separate mechanized brigade - for the heroic defense of Bakhmut and Soledar. Thank you! Gratitude to all our heroes!, Of course, today there is quite high-profile news from Russia. Lots of questions about this. But what actually happened? What did we hear that had not been heard before?, Our positions are clear and well known. Only this should interest us. Not what sounds somewhere, but what is our task., More support for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, more support for intelligence, more support for the Special Operations Forces, more support for the Security Service of Ukraine, for the National Guard, for the police, for the border guards - for everyone who is gradually restoring our territorial integrity., Our positions do not change because of the noise or any announcements somewhere. And we enjoy the full support of our partners in this., We inform all subjects of international relations about what is happening. And we see understanding not only from our partners, but also from those states that tried to stay away from our struggle. There will be steps in support of Ukraine in such circumstances from key international associations as well., So let’s maintain the pressure. Let’s preserve unity. Let’s defend Ukraine. We are liberating our land. And we are not showing any signs of weakness., And I thank all friends and partners of Ukraine for today's mass principled firm condemnation of Russia's attempts to stage new sham referenda., Glory to everyone who defends our state!, Glory to our beautiful people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
19 September 2022  - 20:05 ,The pace of providing aid to Ukraine by partners should correspond to the pace of our movement - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today, I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief – we meet every time we have significant news from the frontline., The Kharkiv region – we are stabilizing the situation, holding our positions. Firmly. So firmly that the occupiers are panicking tangibly. Well, we warned that the Russian soldiers in Ukraine have only two options: flee our land or surrender. The collaborators have similar options - either they will try to escape, and it remains to be seen whether Russia will let them into its territory, even despite giving them its passports, or the collaborators will be convicted according to the current legislation of Ukraine., By the way, I want to thank the National Police for quickly restoring law and order in the newly liberated territory. And the Security Service of Ukraine – for the fact that it is now working with remarkable effectiveness. I cannot reveal all the details, but thanks to the Security Service of Ukraine, we are now confident that the occupiers will not have any foothold on Ukrainian soil., What’s important: the situation at the state border and the protection of our border were discussed at the meeting. The Head of the State Border Service delivered a report. The state will provide all the necessary power to protect our border., We heard the reports by the Commander-in-Chief, commanders of operative directions., We are very attentive to the provision of our warriors on the eve of the winter., Today I want to thank the warriors of the 54th separate mechanized brigade, who are showing resilience in the defense of the Donetsk region. The 95th airborne assault brigade - for extremely brave actions on liberating our territory. The 59th separate motorized infantry brigade is also doing a great job! In the conditions you are fighting, guys, moving forward steadily is truly heroism! The 57th separate motorized infantry brigade - thank you guys for your strength! Thank you for advancing!, The pace is very important now. The pace of stabilization in the liberated areas. The pace of movement of our troops. The pace of restoration of normal life in the liberated territory. And the pace of support from partners. We speak about this honestly - the pace of providing aid to Ukraine should correspond to the pace of our movement. This was also considered today at the meeting., I spoke with Aleksander Čeferin today. I am grateful for the support of our athletes, for unwavering principles. I thanked the UEFA President for his assistance in restarting the Ukrainian Football Premier League. We discussed the opportunities of UEFA to help in the liberation of our athletes - prisoners of war, in providing public support to them., These days, a farewell ceremony for Queen Elizabeth II took place in London. Ukraine honored her memory at a high level - the Prime Minister of Ukraine and the First Lady were present. Among the millions of people who came to pay respects to Her Majesty, there were many Ukrainians. I am thankful to all Ukrainians in the United Kingdom who showed our British friends at this sorrowful moment that Ukraine stands with them., Tomorrow will be a very important day – we are preparing a speech at the UN General Assembly. There will be important signals from our state., I will also take part in the summit on food security – this is a fundamentally important element of global security, and Ukraine has something to say., There will also be online meetings with American partners and investors. We are doing everything to ensure that Ukraine's needs are met at all levels: defense, finance, economy, diplomacy., I am grateful to everyone who helps our country!, I am grateful to everyone who fights for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
18 September 2022  - 21:30 ,"Perhaps it seems to someone that after a series of victories we have a certain lull, but this is preparation - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, I started this day, as always, with a morning conference call., The Commander-in-Chief, the Minister of Internal Affairs, the heads of intelligence, the Minister of Defense, the Minister of Infrastructure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, the Security Service, the Head of the Office, ""Ukroboronprom"" and some others who are responsible for the most important areas of assistance to our defenders., This is how my day starts. Often - with the same questions, often - with similar answers. And this is always the time for the most important words for Ukraine., Izyum, Balakliya, Kupyansk and the Kharkiv region in general are the cities and communities that we have liberated. These words are heard now. They are heard everywhere., Mariupol, Melitopol and Kherson are also heard, but they will sound even more often and louder when we liberate them., Donetsk, Horlivka and Luhansk - they will be heard as well. Dzhankoy, Yevpatoriya, Yalta - and they will, too. Definitely., We do not talk about what’s not ours. Only our words, Ukrainian words, sound., Every morning, every afternoon, every evening, every night - for 207 days already., They sound thanks to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, thanks to the Special Operations Forces, thanks to the Main Intelligence Directorate, thanks to the Security Service of Ukraine, thanks to the territorial defense, thanks to the border guards and the entire system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs - from the National Guard and the National Police to the rescuers of the State Emergency Service., The most important words that are heard thanks to our medical workers and transporters, thanks to energy workers and volunteers, thanks to fighters of the information front and educators, thanks to diplomats and many others who do their job in a way that makes us all stronger. Strengthens our ability to fight and win., Perhaps it seems to someone now that after a series of victories we have a certain lull. But this is not a lull., This is preparation for the next sequence. For the next sequence of words that are very important to us all and that definitely must be heard., Because Ukraine must be free - the whole of it., And in conclusion, as always, words that sound and will always sound. They are heard by us, they will be heard by our children, they will be heard by our grandchildren. They will be heard in free Ukraine., Eternal glory to all our heroes!, Glory to Ukraine!"
17 September 2022  - 21:44 ,We will identify all those who brought atrocities from Russia to Ukrainian land – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Dear Ukrainians!, Today, several of our cities should celebrate their days – the day of the city. In particular, Kherson and Berdiansk, which still remain under the control of the occupiers. Yet. No matter what forces the occupiers spent on them, no matter what they said there, our Kherson and our Berdiansk never lost their Ukrainian soul, never lost their faith in Ukraine. And we do not forget them for a single moment and will definitely return., Just like Kyiv region, Chernihiv region and Sumy region, just like now Kharkiv region, we will liberate other regions and all our land. Wherever there is Ukraine, there will be our flag and nowhere will this atrocity remain – ruscism that repeats what the Nazis did., They don't make soap out of people, they don't make lampshades out of leather... The scale is not the whole of Europe... But the principle is the same. Camps where people are gathered to kill. Deportations. Burnt cities and villages, completely destroyed – nothing remains alive after ruscism. Missile terror. Mass burials. Executioners. The cruelest torture of people still alive. And the boundless, undisguised hatred with which they justify this war that they started., Exhumation work continued today in Izium, Kharkiv region, at the site of the mass burial that had been found. Examinations of the bodies are being conducted. New evidence of the torture used against the people buried there has been found. More than ten torture chambers have already been found in the liberated areas of Kharkiv region – in various cities and towns. As the occupiers fled, they also dropped the devices for torture. Even at the ordinary railway station in Kozacha Lopan, a room for torture and tools for electric torture were found. It's just a railway station! Torture was a widespread practice in the occupied territory. That's what the Nazis did. This is what ruscists do. And they will answer in the same way – both on the battlefield and in courtrooms. We will identify all those who tortured, who humiliated, who brought this atrocity from Russia here, to our Ukrainian land., The situation on the front line has not undergone significant changes over the past day. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, units of our intelligence, SBU, National Guard are gradually, step by step, pushing the occupiers out of our land. But we still need time, we still need effort, we still need to be fully focused on defense and keep all our strength. Many of the Russian soldiers have already realized that they have no chance in Ukraine, that they will be defeated. The most intelligent of the Russian military are surrendered, and we guarantee them compliance with all rights according to the conventions. And we will continue pressing so that all the occupiers understand this. We will beat them harder than before., I'm thankful to all our soldiers – from commanders to privates! I'm thankful to everyone who helps our defense! I'm thankful to all partners who support the investigation of the crimes of the occupiers and work with us to hold Russia accountable for this war and its consequences! And I thank everyone who helps restore normal life after our heroes liberate our land!, Now the liberated areas of Kharkiv region can finally live – food and medicine are delivered, energy supply is restored, pensions have been brought, we are restoring the operation of transport and railways. The time will come – we will also rebuild everything that was destroyed by the occupiers. And there will be a day when I will be able to say this about each of our cities that are still under occupation. And about Kherson, and about Berdiansk, and about Donetsk, and about Luhansk, and about Mariupol. Of course, about Crimea. Ukraine will return. Ukraine will win!, Glory to Ukraine!"
16 September 2022  - 22:38 ,"Russia repeats in Izium what it did in Bucha, world must react to it – address of President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians!, In Kharkiv region, investigative actions are ongoing in the areas that were liberated from the Russian occupation., All the crimes of the Ruscists are being recorded, evidence of their guilt is being collected., Torture chambers where civilians of occupied cities and towns were abused, premises where people were kept – even foreigners – were found. In particular, seven citizens of the Republic of Sri Lanka, students of the Kupyansk Medical College. Back in March, they were captured by Russian soldiers and subsequently kept these people in the basement. Only now, after the liberation of Kharkiv region, these people were saved, they are provided with proper medical care., Exhumation of bodies continues at a mass burial site near Izium. As of now, more than 440 graves have been found. It is too early to say about the number of people buried there, investigations are ongoing., There is already clear evidence of torture, humiliating treatment of people... Moreover, there is evidence that Russian soldiers, whose positions were not far from this place, shot at the buried just for fun., The world must react to all this. Russia has repeated in Izium what it did in Bucha. And now we have just begun to learn the full truth about what was happening in Kharkiv region at that time., It is good that the UN units are already preparing a group of employees who will visit this place near Izium, who will see and be able to report to everyone in the UN system about what the Russian terrorists did., We will ensure full access of journalists to the liberated territory and all places of human abuse. We will provide access to tell the world that ruscism must be condemned., I thank all our partners, all leaders and just our ordinary people who help fight for justice. Fight for the official recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, for the strengthening of sanctions against Russia for this terror., I held a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief Headquarters today. As always, key leaders of the defense and security sector, key representatives of the central government, who ensure the implementation of the defense plan, attended it. Commanders of operative forces reported on the situation on the front line. In addition to completely understandable issues and solutions, the topic of advanced weapons, which will significantly strengthen our army, was also touched upon., I spoke today with the President of Finland. I thanked us for the support we have already received and outlined the additional needs we have. An important topic of conversation was the European policy regarding visas for citizens of the terrorist state. I believe that for every country that shares a common border with Russia, the visa issue is vital and should be resolved in favor of a complete restriction of access for Russian citizens., I also spoke today with representatives of the Nike company. I thanked them for the decision to leave the Russian market. The right decision. This is an example of how business can play a significant role in protecting humanity and freedom. If a state chooses the path of terror, it is the duty of every self-respecting company to distance itself from such a state., Today, a meeting of the group led by Andriy Yermak working on Ukraine's accession to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development took place in the Office, a meeting with the G7 ambassadors and other partner states. This is an extremely important direction, which is important both in the context of European integration and in the context of the internal transformation of our state. During the meeting, the diplomats were given the details of our initiative to create an ad hoc international tribunal to punish Russia for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. I'm thankful to the G7 representatives and other partner countries for their willingness to support Ukraine!, And one more thing. This Saturday we celebrate Rescuer's Day – a professional holiday of those who dedicated their lives to saving others. And it is also the day of those who, under certain circumstances and thanks to their decency and courage, became a rescuer by helping someone else. Today, I honored such people with state awards. And, of course, tomorrow in the evening address I will say more about it. But I want right now, without waiting for tomorrow evening, to congratulate everyone who performs this noble work, who saves people. I want to thank you for the thousands of saved lives, for the security you are returning to us, all Ukrainians., Eternal glory to all who care about people! Please always help each other, always keep unity in everything. We must stick together, all Ukrainians, and that's how we will win., Glory to Ukraine!"
15 September 2022  - 23:39 ,We must show that there will be a tough and principled reaction to every manifestation of Russian terror - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today in Kyiv, a new plaque dedicated to President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen was unveiled on the Walk of the Brave. It was really a great honor and simply a pleasure for me to take part in this unveiling, in the recognition of Mrs. Ursula's bravery. She is one of the central figures of the European policy towards Ukraine, she is one of those thanks to whom the European space and European values are now really being protected., Today Mrs. Ursula has visited our country for the third time since February 24. And every time her visits open a new stage in the rapprochement of Ukraine and the European Union. We discussed all the key points in our relations. But now I want to highlight the issue of integration, the movement of our country towards full membership in the EU., Whatever the circumstances, we will still implement every detail of our arrangements to open the possibility of membership negotiations. Already in November, we are to fulfill the seven recommendations of the European Commission, which we received when we obtained the candidate status. The assessment by the European Commission of our progress in integration should begin as soon as possible. And next year, we should clarify the key issue: when we can start membership negotiations. The Ukrainian side will do everything for this. And as elements of rapprochement, we consider such things as the regime of the EU internal market for Ukraine, as the unification of our institutional work, for example, at customs - in joint customs control between Ukraine and EU countries. We are already working on this., Today I thanked Mrs. Ursula for the support already provided – macro-financial, sanctions, defense. We also discussed energy cooperation, which is extremely important for Ukraine and for every EU country on the eve of this winter, which Russia will try to use against all of us in Europe., I told about a new and particularly vile tactic of Russian terrorists - attacks on energy and hydrotechnical infrastructure. Just during the stay of the President of the European Commission in Ukraine, the Russian army launched new missile attacks on Kryvyi Rih, on the Kirovohrad region. In both cases - on hydrotechnical structures. The purpose of these strikes is completely clear. These are attacks on people, on the normality of life in Ukraine. The terrorist state is trying to show that it can allegedly compensate with such strikes for the cowardice and incompetence of its military, for the failure of its efforts to avoid sanctions and economic isolation., In response, we must show that there will always be a tough and principled reaction to every manifestation of Russian terror. That is why the eighth EU sanctions package is needed - we talked about it with Mrs. Ursula. A principled decision by the United States of America regarding the terrorist state, the legal recognition of this status is also needed, and we discussed this, by the way, recently during the visit of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Kyiv. We also discuss this issue during contacts with congressmen., Progress is needed in providing Ukraine with air defense systems. We already have agreements with certain countries, our diplomats are working with others. I want to emphasize that without providing us with a sufficient number of sufficiently effective air defense systems that will protect the Ukrainian skies, Russia will continue to feel impunity and provoke new local and global crises. Therefore, protecting Ukraine from Russian missiles is truly a basic element of global security., In general, supporting Ukraine with weapons, ammunition and finances is crucial for peace in Europe. The better support we have, the sooner this war will end. I talked about it with the representatives of the leading think tanks of Poland, Britain, France and the US who arrived in Kyiv. Real protection of freedom and common values of the free world is possible now only as a result of Ukraine's victory in this war., I also spoke about further support for Ukraine with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. As always, very substantive, specific. We discussed various security issues, including Russian missile strikes, defense assistance, training of our military, prospects for the developments on the battlefield, restoration of critical infrastructure before the winter period. I am grateful to Mr. Prime Minister for the support already provided to us, in particular financial, for the funds for the purchase of gas. And for understanding the steps we need to take to ruin Russia's terrorist plans., An important IAEA resolution was adopted today - a resolution demanding that Russia cease all actions against the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant at the plant itself, at any other nuclear facility in Ukraine. Although international organizations are often limited in their ability to respond, we see that the IAEA clearly identifies the source of radiation danger, namely: the Russian military presence at the Zaporizhzhia power plant, Russian actions against the nuclear power plant. Therefore, the complete demilitarization of the plant, the immediate withdrawal of all Russian troops from there is the only thing that can ensure the implementation of this IAEA resolution. And this is also a basic element of global security. As long as Russian soldiers remain at the nuclear power plant, the world remains on the brink of a radiation disaster – worse than even Chornobyl. And it is the joint responsibility of everyone in Europe and the world - to remove the Russian presence from the territory of the ZNPP., Today I want to thank all the representatives of the State Emergency Service, utility services, construction workers, police officers, military personnel, representatives of local authorities, business representatives - everyone who is involved in eliminating the consequences of Russian missile terror, who helps those who suffered from the strikes. In Kryvyi Rih and the Kirovohrad region, in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, in Mykolaiv and the Donetsk region - in all the cities and communities that Russia tortures with its missiles., The terrorist state has already used more than 3,800 different missiles against us. But no missile will bring Russia closer to its goal. There will be no subjugation of Ukraine. And each missile brings Russia closer to greater international isolation, greater economic degradation and even clearer historical condemnation., And finally. A mass burial site was found in Izyum, Kharkiv region. The necessary procedural actions have already begun there. There should be more information - clear, verified information - tomorrow. Tomorrow there will be Ukrainian and international journalists in Izyum. We want the world to know what is really happening and what the Russian occupation has led to. Bucha, Mariupol, now, unfortunately, Izyum... Russia leaves death everywhere. And it must be held accountable for that. The world must hold Russia to real account for this war. We will do everything for this., Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken away by the occupiers! Eternal glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
15 September 2022  - 02:10 ,"We will respond to the terrorists for each of their vile acts, for each missile – we are capable of that – address by the President of Ukraine",", Ukrainians!, I’ve returned from the Kharkiv region - from our Kharkiv region, from the districts that were liberated., As of today, almost the entire region is de-occupied. It was an unprecedented movement of our warriors – Ukrainians once again managed to do what many considered impossible. On the first day of active operations alone, our troops advanced 19 kilometers. 110 kilometers were covered in five days of fighting. In total, almost 400 settlements were de-occupied. The 150,000 Ukrainians who remained in this territory feel again now what an ordinary, safe, normal life is like., The Russian army has been in the Kharkiv region for more than five months. And during this time, the occupiers did not even try to do anything for the people. They only destroyed, only deprived, only took away. They left behind devastated villages, and in some of them there is not a single undamaged house. The occupiers left schools turned into garbage dumps, and churches – broken, literally turned into toilets., Journalists - both Ukrainian and foreign journalists - gained access to the liberated areas. The world must see this destruction, must feel the pain that Russia has brought to Ukrainians. Our law enforcement officers already receive reports of murders, tortures and abductions by the occupiers. What the world saw in Bucha, what we saw in the de-occupied territory of the Chernihiv region, Sumy region, and what we are seeing now in the Kharkiv region are evidence of genocide against Ukrainians. Evidence that Russia cannot bring anything else except for genocide., And I will speak in Russian to ""comrades""., Your missile attacks today, Russian missiles targeting Kryvyi Rih, the dam of the Karachunivske Reservoir, the objects that have no military value at all, in fact hitting hundreds of thousands of ordinary civilians, is another reason why Russia will lose. And not just this war, but history itself., History is written by people, never by savages. Who will you remain in history? All those who launch these missiles. Those who came to our land. Weaklings. You are weaklings waging a war against civilians. Scoundrels who, having fled the battlefield, are trying to do harm from somewhere far away. You will remain terrorists whom their own grandchildren will be ashamed of., Events show that the only way out for Russian soldiers is to surrender to Ukrainian forces. This is the only option that guarantees them life and attitude in accordance with all conventions. Every Russian soldier should have already understood that only in Ukrainian captivity will no one use him as cannon fodder in a war that is obviously losing for Russia., At the site of the missile attack on Kryvyi Rih, everything is being done to eliminate the consequences of this yet another Russian vile act. A vile act, which may please insane Russian propagandists, but will certainly not save the moral and psychological state of Russian soldiers. They understood that the Russian command is incompetent, and that a rout awaits them in Ukraine on all fronts. Russia will not fix this with any terror, as terror only confirms the weakness of the one who resorts to it., Today in Izyum, I awarded our heroes. It was an honor for me to present state awards on this very land to those who liberated this land. I am grateful to the warriors of the 14th and 92nd separate mechanized brigades, the 25th separate airborne brigade, the 80th separate airborne assault brigade - everyone who in just five days forced the enemy to retreat in panic, abandoning equipment, ammunition, numerous Russian flags. I am grateful to the 107th MLRS brigade, the 40th, 43rd, 44th separate artillery brigades, the 26th artillery brigade. I want to thank the 15th separate artillery reconnaissance brigade - all the warriors who ensured the timely destruction of enemy targets and the advance of our ground units. And, of course, I am grateful to the fighters of the Main Intelligence Directorate, all who skillfully turned the enemy's panic into real hysteria., I am grateful to Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrsky and the officers of his staff - everyone who planned and successfully conducted the military operation to liberate the Kharkiv region., The Ukrainian flag will return to all parts of our country. Just like in the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian warriors will be met in Donbas, in the south, and in Crimea. It will happen, it will definitely happen., I also held a meeting today in Kharkiv regarding the energy situation in the city and the region. We take into account the fact that the terrorist state can resort to any new vile acts. All levels of Ukrainian authorities - both central and local, rescue services, energy companies, transporters - are tasked with preparing for any scenarios. Reserves for energy, heat and water supply are needed - for all possible cases., We are preparing for tomorrow's active day. We are waiting for the news from the frontline. There will be diplomatic news from Kyiv - President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen is paying a visit. Today was almost a Ukrainian day in Brussels. For the first time in the history of the European Union, a state from outside the EU was actually represented at a special session of the European Parliament during the annual State of the EU Report - this is our state. So far - from outside the EU. We are working for full membership – politically, legally, symbolically., The First Lady of Ukraine was present during this annual report of the President of the European Commission. We have an important result of this visit - one hundred million euros for the reconstruction of 74 schools in Ukraine in the framework of the Fast Recovery Plan. We will do everything to implement a large-scale social initiative - cancellation of roaming charges for our people in the EU and for Europeans in Ukraine. This will be a strong signal of our rapprochement. And I thank Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, I thank all our friends in the European Union for their unwavering support., I am thankful to all our warriors! I am thankful to everyone who participates in the rescue operations after the Russian strikes. We will respond to the terrorists for each of their vile acts, for each missile, for each projectile. We are capable of that., Glory to Ukraine! "
13 September 2022  - 22:10 ,"Together with our troops and our flag, ordinary normal life comes to the de-occupied territory - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The participants, as before, are Reznikov, Zaluzhny, Syrsky, Kovalchuk, Litvinov, Yermak, Monastyrskyi, Kubrakov, Danilov, Lebid and others., The first and most important issue is the reports of commanders by direction. Oleksandr Syrsky reported on the successes in the Kharkiv region, Andriy Kovalchuk - on the movement of our troops in the south., We considered the draft budget for defense and security for the next year., The situation in the liberated territory of our state was analyzed in detail. As of now, stabilization measures have been completed in the districts with a total area of more than 4,000 square kilometers. Stabilization continues in the liberated territory of approximately the same size. Remnants of occupiers and sabotage groups are being detected, collaborators are being detained and full security is being restored., Border guards are tasked with protecting the state border in the liberated territory., Once again, I thank all our fighters who ensured such a large-scale and quick defeat of the invaders in the territory of the Kharkiv region!, By the way, today I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 153 combatants were awarded state awards, 12 of them posthumously. All - for bravery in the battles in the east of our country - in the Kharkiv region, in Donbas., It is very important that together with our troops, with our flag, ordinary normal life comes to the de-occupied territory. As an example, in Balakliya, in Hrakove, the payment of pensions for five months at once, for the time when we simply could not make payments due to the occupation, has already been started. And all Ukrainian pensioners in the liberated territory will receive payments. Ukraine always fulfills its social obligations to people., Today I held a meeting with the Defense Ministers of Denmark and Estonia who arrived in Kyiv. Of course, we talked about further support for our state, about further pressure on Russia. I thanked them for the principled and consistent help in protecting people's freedom and life., I held negotiations with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. I thanked her for the allocation of $1.4 billion in additional support for our state. We discussed a new program of cooperation and, in general, the preservation of Ukraine's financial stability., We have a result in our work on security guarantees for our state. Today, a package of recommendations was presented by the international group led by Andriy Yermak and Anders Fogh Rasmussen - these are the recommendations that should form the basis of the future system of security treaties that will give Ukrainians peace of mind and guarantee the prevention of any war against Ukraine., We are working to ensure that the strongest subjects of the free world become guarantors of the security of our state. So that at the multilateral and bilateral level, it is stipulated in detail who, how and when should react in case of any threat to the state security of Ukraine. React with sanctions, arms supply, all the necessary material and financial support., The main thing is clear and legally binding steps, specific and timely actions, in particular, preventive actions aimed at preventing war and cooling the aggressor's intentions. That is, everything that our country did not have before and because of which Russia had the illusion it could go unpunished for the war against Ukraine., Together with our partners, we have already built a powerful anti-war coalition, which includes dozens of different states. And now we are working to ensure that the most powerful states that are already helping us become a coalition of peace that will last forever., I spoke today with Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi. I informed him about the situation on the frontline, about the successes of our state. We always note: in every victory of Ukraine there is also a victory of those who, together with us, defend freedom and European values. Italy is among the strongest., Mr. Draghi and I discussed the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the Russian provocations in great detail. Thank you for understanding that the demilitarization of the ZNPP is a fundamental condition for the return of radiation safety to all of us in Europe., I am grateful to everyone who helps our country expel the occupiers!, I am grateful to each of our warriors who do everything to bring victory closer!, Glory to Ukraine!"
12 September 2022  - 23:00 ,We still need to strengthen our cooperation with partners to overcome Russian terror – address by the President of Ukraine,", Ukrainians!, All Europeans!, And everyone in the world who believes that terror should have no place on earth., Why is the biggest source of terror in the world - Russia - still able to wage this war? And why can it wage the war so cruelly and cynically? There is only one reason - insufficient pressure on Russia. The response to the terror of this state is insufficient., Just look at what Russia can afford. No other terrorist has ever done this in history - so many things at once., Radiation terror at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Six power units! The presence of Russian troops at the plant, constant Russian provocations and shelling of the plant’s territory alone put Ukraine and all of Europe on the brink of a radiation disaster., Energy terror. Residents of many countries around the world are suffering due to the painful increase in prices for energy resources - for electricity, for heat. Russia does it deliberately. It deliberately destabilizes the gas market in Europe. With its strikes it deliberately limits our Ukrainian ability to export electricity to Europe. The export of electricity from Ukraine could alleviate the severity of the energy crisis in Europe in the same way that the export of our food relieves the severity of the food crisis in the world., Hunger terror is a very cynical and completely deliberate tactic of Russia. And it is directed not just against poor countries, but specifically against those regions of the world from which a new inflow of refugees may come to Europe. Severe migrant crisis in Europe - this is the calculation of the terrorist state., Fortunately, together with our partners, together with the UN, Turkey, we managed to achieve an export grain initiative. Russia was forced to unblock our ports. But now it is threatening a blockade again., And how does the world react? There is still no official recognition of Russia as a state - sponsor of terrorism. Citizens of the terrorist state can still travel to Europe for vacation or shopping, they can still get European visas, and no one knows whether there are torturers or murderers among them who have just returned from the occupied territory of Ukraine. Until now, Russian propagandists can still work precisely in those countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe, which are threatened with the greatest chaos due to price and energy crises created by Russia. We are still forced to ask for help in protecting our skies from Russian missiles - after 200 days of full-scale war!, Yesterday and today, the Russian army struck the Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians found themselves in the dark - without electricity. Houses, hospitals, schools, communal infrastructure... Russian missiles hit precisely those objects that have absolutely nothing to do with the infrastructure of the Armed Forces of our country., On the one hand, this is a sign of the desperation of those who invented this war. This is how they react to the defeat of Russian troops in the Kharkiv region. They can't do anything to our heroes on the battlefield, and that's why Russia is directing its vile strikes against civilian infrastructure., On the other hand, Russia is trying to prevent us from directing Ukraine's capabilities in such a way as to stabilize the situation in Europe. Our electricity export is something that Russia is very afraid of right now. Because we can disrupt Russian plans to empty the pockets of Europeans this winter due to crazy energy prices., We still need to strengthen our cooperation in order to overcome Russian terror. Russia must be designated a terrorist state. Strengthen sanctions - the eighth EU sanctions package is needed. Increase aid to Ukraine, and above all speed up the provision of air defense systems., I am grateful to all the rescuers who fought the consequences of Russian missile strikes at energy facilities. Hundreds of settlements in several regions of Ukraine were cut off due to these strikes., At the request of the Minister of Internal Affairs, today I would like to especially note the contribution to the stabilization of the situation of Major General of the Civil Protection Service Oleksandr Volobuyev, Colonel of the Civil Protection Service Oleksandr Mislavskyi, Senior Lieutenant of the Civil Protection Service Vitaliy Dzyabko, Ensign of the Civil Protection Service Denys Kostenko and fireman, Ensign Oleksandr Gulyi. Thank you. I am grateful to you and your colleagues!, The energy supply of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Poltava region, Sumy region, Kharkiv region and the city of Kharkiv was restored. But today there are new strikes at energy facilities. New blackouts in Kharkiv. And we must be aware that the meanness of Russian terrorists knows no bounds - they will try to make such a form of terror systematic., On my behalf, the Prime Minister of Ukraine held a meeting today with the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Territories and Communities Development of Ukraine, the Ministry of Finance and Naftogaz. A coordinating headquarters will be formed to quickly respond to all such manifestations of Russian terror. Funds will also be allocated for the restoration of damaged objects and for assistance to the de-occupied territories., From the beginning of September until today, our warriors have already liberated more than 6,000 square kilometers of the territory of Ukraine - in the east and south. The movement of our troops continues., I am thankful to the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade, which has recovered from heavy fighting in the east and is advancing very bravely, very confidently in the south direction., I am thankful to the 59th separate motorized infantry brigade for steadily moving forward despite everything - despite the features of the open terrain, despite the artillery of the occupiers., I am thankful to the fighters of the 128th separate mountain assault brigade for the liberation of several settlements and very effective actions to neutralize the enemy's activity. Guys, you are true heroes!, Separately, I want to thank our anti-aircraft fighters today. Yesterday, we all saw the consequences of the Russian strikes. But at the same time, most of the terrorists' missiles were shot down. Nine of the twelve missiles were shot down. Seven missiles were shot down by warriors of the 138th Dnipro anti-aircraft missile brigade of the ""East"" air command, and two missiles were shot down by the sky defenders of the 96th Kyiv anti-aircraft missile brigade of the ""Center"" air command. Thank you, our defenders!, Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine!, Thank you to everyone who is really ready to fight against Russian terror!, We bring victory closer every day., Glory to Ukraine!"
11 September 2022  - 22:10 ,"I want to dedicate this address to those who have been bravely standing for 200 days, being the exact reason why Ukraine stands - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Fellow Ukrainians!, Today is 200 days of our resistance. Our struggle. Our people’s war. For freedom, for independence, for the right to be. In these 200 days, we have achieved a lot, but the most important, and therefore the most difficult, is ahead. And I want to dedicate this address to those who are ahead. Who are having the hardest time now, as they are doing the most important thing., These are all defenders of Ukraine. All those who have been courageously standing for 200 days, being the exact reason why Ukraine stands. Strong, and that is why we are free. Unbreakable, and that is why we are independent. Our fighters, who heroically restrained the enemy, and now they do not restrain themselves. And they drive the occupiers out in the north, south and east. In all directions, but moving in only one direction - forward and towards victory., 200 days of Ukrainian resistance. Almost 5 thousand hours. Almost 300 thousand minutes. Almost 20 million seconds. And just as many reasons to say ""thank you"" today to everyone who made this possible. Millions of times. Without any ""almost"". To say that we believe in them, believe in their victory. Without any ""almost""., These are all our warriors of the Armed Forces of Ukraine., Ground troops, our infantry. You know better than anyone else: there is little romance in war and a lot of hard work. These days, it is courageously and selflessly performed by our separate mechanized brigades. The 92nd – named after Kish otaman Ivan Sirko. The 54th – named after Hetman Ivan Mazepa. The 14th – named after Prince Roman the Great. The 60th Inhulets separate infantry brigade. Step by step in the Kharkiv region, Kherson region, Donbas, with weapons, shovels, hands, teeth – you are ""gnawing away"" every meter, every frontier, every city and village of ours., These are our tank troops. Those who forge the future victory in iron gloves. And today, on the day of the professional holiday, as well. These are the 3rd, 4th, 5th separate tank brigades, tank regiments and battalions, tank companies within the airborne assault troops, the 17th separate Kryvyi Rih tank brigade named after Kostiantyn Pestushko. And especially - the 1st separate tank Siversk brigade. I sincerely congratulate all of you and everyone involved on Tanker's Day., These are our missile troops and artillery. You are rightfully called the ""gods of war"". You send the occupiers to the divine trial. You send the demons back to hell. Today, the 406th separate artillery brigade named after brigadier-general Oleksiy Almazov is doing this with special fervor and spark in their eyes. We are grateful to its fighters and in general to everyone whom we warmly call ""our arta""., How would one describe your jewelry work in two words? Accurate and loud. We thank you for every ""accurate"" and every ""loud"". For all destroyed enemy convoys, warehouses, bases and headquarters. Important crossings and bridges. Where your efforts cause fire and where the enemy violated the rules of fire safety. People online wish you accurate calculations and new hits, and they address the occupiers in a language they understand: ""Stop smoking everywhere. Smoke where there hasn’t been a hit yet""., These are our Air Forces. Bombing, assault, fighter, reconnaissance, military transport aviation. Defending Ukraine you are always on top., These are our Airborne Assault Troops. You are always the first! Because it is no one but you! These slogans are not just words. The enemy has been aware of this for eight years and 200 days. And today, the occupiers especially feel the strength and power of the 79th airborne assault brigade, the 25th and 80th airborne brigades. In particular, in the Kharkiv region, which you are successfully liberating from the enemies. And in the Donetsk region, where you are successfully repelling the enemy., We are sure: in both areas there will be one finale - your victory. For this, one doesn’t need to read forecasts, it is enough to read your oath. You are the paratroopers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. You will never accept defeat. You will never retreat in the face of difficulties. You will never leave your brothers-in-arms in danger. You are always ready to destroy the enemies of Ukraine in battle. You are the paratroopers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine!, These are our Naval Forces. You proved that it doesn't matter what fleet the enemy has, what flagship he has, when Neptune is on your side. Guards of native shores. Missile boats, artillery, minesweeping and landing craft, naval aviation, naval artillery and, of course, marines. And I especially want to note the 503rd separate battalion of the marines. On your chevrons there is an inscription: ""If this is an offensive, this is us."" In our hearts there are words: if this is you, this is success and victory., These are the air defense troops of Ukraine. Anti-aircraft missile troops, radio engineering troops, air defense of the Ground and Naval Forces. You hear an air raid alert differently than most. Most descend into shelter. You direct your gaze upwards to destroy enemy missiles, aircraft, helicopters and drones., This is our intelligence. For obvious reasons, very few people know your names, your faces. Your operations are not usually written about in the news, but they will definitely be written about in military science textbooks. Your successes are often quiet and imperceptible to our people, but always painful and tangible to our enemy., These days, intelligence officers are especially showing themselves. The 131st separate reconnaissance battalion of military intelligence of Ukraine. Those who are always ahead. I thank you, I thank all the units of the Main Intelligence Directorate and all our intelligence officers, thanks to whom we always see, always hear, always know, always act. And we will definitely win., These are our special forces, Special Operations Forces. Those who attack. Those who prevail not in quantity, but in quality. Those who have a special power to fight on the edge of possible and impossible., These are the territorial defense forces. And we especially note the fighters of the separate 115th and 117th territorial defense brigades., These are medical troops that save the lives of our warriors. These are military clergy, chaplains who pray for the lives of our warriors. These are our engineers, communications officers, cyber army., These are those who have been defending and serving the state side by side with the Armed Forces of Ukraine for eight years, for 200 days and right now. I thank all the warriors of the National Guard, its special forces, in particular the 15th Sloviansk regiment. I am thankful to all our border guards. To the officers and employees of the Security Service of Ukraine, the National Police, the State Emergency Service, our firefighters, rescuers, sappers. And altogether - to all our warriors, defenders, the best sons and daughters of Ukraine who are liberating its north, south and east today., To everyone who in 200 days destroyed more than 2,000 enemy tanks, 4,500 armored combat vehicles, more than 1,000 enemy artillery systems, 250 aircraft and 200 helicopters, almost 1,000 drones, 15 ships and boats, thousands of other enemy equipment units., Liberated hundreds of our towns and villages. Who broke the plans of the enemy, because they did not break themselves. All those who held the defense and defended Kyiv. Saved our capital, and thus preserved our faith in our victory., All those who strengthened and multiplied it by protecting Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro. Everyone who defended Mariupol and Azovstal. Liberated the Kyiv region, Zhytomyr region, Chernihiv region, Sumy region. Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Vorzel, Hostomel, Makariv. Okhtyrka, Sumy. And now - Balakliya, Izyum, Kupyansk., All those who liberated, liberate and will liberate all temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. Bring back the Ukrainian flag to Kherson, Berdyansk, Melitopol, Luhansk, Horlivka, Yenakijeve, Mariupol and Donetsk, Yalta, Dzhankoy, Kerch, Yevpatoriya, Simferopol. Who have been working 200% all these 200 days., The enemies said that they got lost, that they were going to an exercise. You taught them a lot. The ability to quickly get dressed and get out of our land, and the understanding that, by abandoning equipment and weapons, it can be done much faster and easier., Many of them have forever learned that it is correct to say not ""on Ukraine"" but ""in Ukraine"". I am talking about all those who set foot on our land and stayed in it. Many will forever remember what awaits all uninvited guests in Ukraine. Our warriors., Today, everyone sees and notes your actions in the north, south and east of Ukraine. The world is impressed. The enemy is panicking. Ukraine is proud of you, believes in you, prays for you, and is waiting for you., The path to victory is a difficult one. But we are sure: you are capable of it. You will reach our border, all its sections. You will see our frontiers and the enemies’ backs. You will see the shining of the eyes of our people and of the occupiers’ heels. They will call it ""goodwill gestures"". We'll call it a victory., We believe in you, in those who have been doing their job, risking their lives, defending their country for all these 200 days at -15°C or +35°C, at 2 am or 6 am, on an ordinary Monday or on Independence Day, despite fatigue, tension and danger., All who were definitely ready. Who do not pay attention to rumors and gossip. Who do not read fakes on the Internet, but write the history in real life. The history of independence. The history of victory. The history of Ukraine. Our warriors, our fighters, our defenders. For us, you are definitely the first army of the world., Glory to you!, Glory to Ukraine!"
10 September 2022  - 22:32 ,"Currently, the geopolitical configuration in the world is changing, but the completion of the unification of Europe is impossible without Ukraine - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the annual YES meeting",", Dear attendees!, Mr. President Levits!, Dear Mr. Prime Minister of our friends - the Republic of Poland, Mr. Morawiecki!, Dear participants and guests of the forum!, Dear journalists!, I am glad to see you all here at the annual meeting of the Yalta European Strategy. This year, we are meeting at the forum in Kyiv again, but still we are the closest to our Yalta in all eight years of the Kyiv YES period and the most united for the sake of Ukrainian interests in all the years of independence of our mighty state., I think you all have this feeling - even confidence. I think you have a feeling that we are coming back and getting stronger. And I’m asking now all of you who are in this hall to express gratitude with applause to our warriors who are bringing our victory and our return home closer., The path to the return of our entire territory is all there, every day it becomes clearer. We see the contours of restoring the territorial integrity of our state. We know that this is a difficult path, but we know that this difficult path is real and we are doing it., But this is the path. The path, on which there are certain difficult stages, and none of them can be bypassed unfortunately. This is a path that requires bravery – all the time. A path that requires endurance all the time as well. A path on which we cannot allow the weakening of our unity, both within the state and the unity of our global anti-war coalition., This is the path from the Kharkiv region, where people who have been under occupation for months are now greeting the Ukrainian soldiers with tears of happiness... The path to those cities and villages of ours that are still waiting strenuously, and also many with tears, because they are living people, for the return of the Ukrainian flag, and therefore, the return of freedom, security, a chance for the future. We cannot afford to stop. This is my main message to anyone out there who is thinking about something. Even to some of the leaders that are pushing us somewhere, into someone's inappropriate embrace. No, we cannot afford to stop., The path from this time, when the whole state is fully focused and united for the sake of victory, to that special moment when we will finally be able to feel that the victory has taken place., I know the key question on everyone's mind right now is when? When will we pass this path? When will the victory come? The answer to this question can be given by the stage that is right ahead of us. I speak frankly: it will be a difficult stage. We have to endure this winter. I don't want to talk in ephemeral numbers, just some words, I'm talking about specifics., This will be the most difficult winter in the whole world. These will be 90 days that will be a test for our faith in victory. A test for our endurance and unity, for our ability to protect ourselves, the whole world, freedom and fundamental values for any person in the world., Russia is doing everything to break the resistance of Ukraine, the resistance of Europe and the world in 90 days of this winter. Because this is what Russia hopes for. This is its last argument. The last one, I am sure of it: the cruelty of the winter period, which is supposed to help when the cruelty of man is not enough. And we must be ready - not to break down, not to split, not to deviate from our path., There are 90 days ahead, which will be more crucial than 30 years of Ukraine's independence. 90 days that will be more crucial than all the years of the existence of the European Union. Winter will determine our future and the risks., We have no doubt in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in our intelligence, in our special services and in all our people - great people of Ukraine in the occupied territory, who are helping Ukrainian warriors liberate our land. But for this to happen, we need specifics - weapons, ammunition, financial and political support, stronger than ever diplomacy, determination at different levels of the world. Therefore, we need the preservation of the unity of our partners and their willingness to help. To help without waiting for us to say that that’s enough. We are grateful for everything you have done, but there will not be enough for victory until there is victory., We have no doubt that we can get through the winter without Russian energy resources. Not only Ukraine, but all reputable European states. But for this to happen, you need to be ready to prevent any Russian sabotage - armed or political, and it is very important to prevent disinformation steps by Russia. And therefore, we need even more coordination, firmness, and pressure on Russia., The world must overcome the price crisis, which Russia is trying to exacerbate with various of its well-known tools - it destabilizes markets, provokes hunger, intimidates people, ordinary people, intimidates them in various countries. And it is possible to protect yourself from this price crisis only through the complete dismantling of Russian influence - influence on European societies, on world markets and on the global information space., It is an ambitious, complex goal, it exists, it is alive, but it is necessary to complete the dismantling of Russian influence now in preparation for winter - before the crucial 90 days. During the autumn, it is necessary to strengthen sanctions on Russia, officials, banks, and companies as much as possible. You know all this. It is necessary to agree on all mechanisms for real limitation of Russian export income. It is necessary to provide all the legal and political bases for the implementation of an international compensation mechanism and the confiscation of Russian assets abroad to compensate for the losses caused by this war to the people of Ukraine. Maximum visa restrictions for the citizens of the Russian Federation are needed to encourage them to launch a visible anti-war movement. Not just populism, but a noticeable movement, noticeable courage. And also the blocking of Russian propaganda and the deportation of all propagandists from all democratic countries - so that Russia does not even have a chance to sow political and social chaos. Chaotization, splits, discord are Russia's bet, the bet in their bloody casino, the bet there and then, where and when it cannot use conventional weapons., We must prepare our societies, they must know the truth, for the existing risks. The winter will be difficult for everyone - from Latvia and Poland to Britain and the United States. War is war. It is in the world. Winter will be hard. But we can make this winter the most difficult for Russia, for the one who is responsible for all the created problems - military, social, price problems, energy problems and many others. We can make the path to our victory clearer after these 90 days., Although different societies will have a hard time in the winter, each society should know that after these 90 days, real security begins for decades from all those threats that are so painfully experienced now. When we endure all this, our neighbor will never be able to do anything to all of us. Russia has already embarked on the path of its historic defeat - and the clarity of this path, the contours of its defeat will become obvious after these 90 days. If we are all honest and persevere. All who value peace more than war. Ukrainians, Europeans, the whole world., We see how the countries of our continent are now preparing for the winter. These restrictions are complex - restrictions on energy consumption, restrictions on temperatures in homes for the heating season. The EU already did a lot to protect itself when Russia triggered this energy price shock, and today only 9 percent of gas is supplied to EU countries from Russia. And be sure that Russia will make zero gas supplies, and our energy systems must be fully prepared for this., Every day we try to do everything necessary to protect our sky. This is even more important in the winter, when Russian missiles can and will target enterprises and infrastructure that provide people with heat and electricity. Now is the time for partners to fulfill their promises to help Ukraine with air defense systems., Now is the time to end the Russia-created crisis at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The threat of a radiation disaster is definitely not what the European Union, Turkey and other states - those in the directions of the wind that can spread radiation pollution - should enter the winter with. But something else is also important - the stable operation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the framework of the Ukrainian energy system can become one of the key, important elements of guaranteeing stable energy consumption by Europe during these 90 days., We already export electricity to our neighbors, which helps replace dirty Russian energy resources, and we can easily increase exports to at least two and a half gigawatts, and eventually even more. Today we talked about it with the Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland - they want it, we want it. So we will do it. But for this, it is necessary to ensure that the Russian troops withdraw from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP. This is a fundamental European interest now, at this time before winter., Ladies and Gentlemen!, When I said that we cannot afford to stop, I did not mean only our heroic warriors who are liberating the Ukrainian land., Now there is a change in the geopolitical configuration in the world as a whole, in Europe. And economic unification in Europe has been achieved. I believe that political unification in Europe has been achieved. This is all obvious at the level of institutions, relations, and everyday life. But now a real value-based unification of the entire continent is being achieved - and, by the way, thanks to Ukraine as well. The last barriers that existed between European countries are disappearing - and this is thanks to the fact that Europe really protects freedom. Europe is gaining real independence., Russia creates the illusion that Europeans must make a choice - such a difficult choice between prices and values, between freedom and security, between independence and peace. But there is no such choice. It is an impossible choice. When values are weak, prices are sky high. When freedom suffers, there is no security. When independence is lost, peace is impossible. Therefore, we must not deviate from our path, we have no right to get tired, God forbid, of Ukraine and stop. All of us - all Ukrainians and all of us Europeans., We must fight. Endure the winter. Help those who are weaker. Protect those who need protection more. Limit ourselves in what can be limited. And limit Russia in everything that should limit it. Give warmth to those whom Russia wants to leave without warmth. And give food to those who are forced by Russia to starve. Continue to fulfill the three fundamental conditions for achieving peace - weapons, ammunition, finances. Support for Ukraine in the war must be maintained., And one more important element. Completing the unification of Europe is impossible without Ukraine. Therefore, this winter we must do absolutely everything to say in the spring: we are fully ready to start negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union. It will be a historic moment, a historic time - when it will be an honor for Europe to welcome our state. The state that wins., Believe in victory!, Defend Ukraine!, Help our heroes!, And we will definitely endure the winter!, Glory to Ukraine!"
10 September 2022  - 21:34 ,"Since early September, about 2,000 kilometers of Ukraine's territory have already been liberated – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Dear Ukrainians!, First of all, today I want to congratulate two of our cities, beautiful, strong cities, on their day – Lyman and Dnipro., Lyman in Donetsk region is still waiting for our flag, and this is inevitable – Ukraine always returns. We demonstrate it well. The entire Donetsk region will be liberated, will be safe and happy again, as it should be in Ukraine, as it should be everywhere on our land., The Armed Forces of Ukraine and all those who defend our state, the Special Operations Forces, our intelligence, special services, the National Guard, the police will restore peace in every corner of our state, where Russia has brought only grief and suffering., There will be peace. Peace goes together with the Ukrainian flag, together with our defenders., Dear residents of Dnipro! Your city has done so much for Ukrainian defense both since 2014 and since February 24 that the history of our victory is also the history of Dnipro, it is undoubtedly well deserved., The health and lives of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers were saved in Dnipro. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians received shelter and help in Dnipro during the war years. The front has always felt and still feels the support of the people of Dnipro. I thank you all for this! And I wish you all, as well as all Ukrainians, one thing – the fastest possible victory., I held a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief Headquarters today. Reports on the situation on the front lines from the commanders of operative areas were presented. The necessary decisions were made., We discussed support of our military. We listened to the report of Defense Minister Reznikov on the results of the meeting at Ramstein Air Base. Thanks to our partners for their support!, The movement of our soldiers in different directions of the front continues. As of now, as part of active actions since the beginning of September, about 2,000 kilometers of our territory have already been liberated., These days, the Russian army is showing its best – showing its back. And, in the end, it is a good choice for them to run away. There is and will be no place for the occupiers in Ukraine. However, I emphasize once again: if any of the Russian troops or security forces men are afraid to return to Russia now, we guarantee that everyone who is detained by our soldiers will be treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions., I spoke today with French President Macron. I briefed him on our activity at the front, about further prospects. We discussed Russian provocations at the Zaporizhzhia NPP and the need for immediate demilitarization of the plant and the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from there. I also talked with Mr. President about increasing defense support of our country, about increasing pressure on Russia, in particular about sanctions pressure, about visa restrictions for citizens of the Russian Federation., The arrangements reached during yesterday's agreements with Head of the Polish government Morawiecki were developed at a meeting devoted to the issues of support for our Polish brothers during this autumn and winter, our energy cooperation with Poland, as I promised him., I instructed to speed up the reconstruction of the power transmission line from the Khmelnytsky NPP to the Polish city of Rzeszów – the first Savior City. Thank you, Rzeszów. Let me remind that this special title was awarded to Rzeszów back in the spring for extremely important assistance to Ukraine. We must complete this reconstruction by December 8 and provide Poland with the necessary amount of electricity., Of course, all this is possible only if Ukraine maintains normal control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. We are working on the international solutions required for this., I also instructed the Cabinet of Ministers to work out the possibility of an urgent supply of 100,000 tonnes of thermal coal to Poland right now. We currently have sufficient volumes for ourselves and can help our brothers prepare for this winter., Today, I welcomed the delegation of UK parliamentarians who arrived in Kyiv. Their negotiations with Head of the Office Andriy Yermak took place – they were very substantive. Among the most important things are security guarantees for Ukraine, our interaction with the UK, as well as the possibilities of our coordination in such regions as, for example, Latin America. We must continue expanding our anti-war coalition., Today, I had a very interesting and useful meeting with Timothy Snyder, a well-known historian, Professor at Yale University and a great friend of Ukraine. Mr. Snyder did a lot to make our country, our people, and our history known and understood in the world. His books are well known to Ukrainian and international readers. And soon there will be another book, he is preparing it now., I was pleased to share some memories of both February 24 and the events of the previous time. We discussed the nature of Russian aggression, propaganda, and the evil that the occupiers are doing. They will definitely be responsible for everything they have done on Ukrainian land., Today, I'm thankful to the soldiers of the 15th Slavic Regiment of the National Guard of Ukraine, who distinguished themselves in the Kharkiv direction. Well done!, I'm thankful to the troops of the 214th separate rifle battalion for securing the situation in Balakliya, who, together with units of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Special Operations Forces, special forces of the National Guard and the police, returned full control to the city., I'm thankful to all our defenders, who during these weeks made the approach of the main thing we need – our victory – even more tangible!, Glory to Ukraine!"
9 September 2022  - 22:18 ,"As of now, the Armed Forces of Ukraine liberate and take control of more than 30 settlements in Kharkiv region – address of President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, We have good news from the European Union. The provision of EUR 5 billion of macro-financial assistance to our state has been approved. It's very important., And secondly, there is a decision of the Council of the EU to suspend the visa facilitation agreement signed by the EU and Russia. This decision will be effective from Monday. And there are specific recommendations of the European Commission regarding visa restrictions for citizens of Russia., This is the protection of Europe, it will make it difficult for those who do not want to change anything, do not want to fight against the war, but just want to consume and have fun, as if nothing is happening in Europe, as if there is no Russian terror., United Europe is the second target for Russia after our state, our independence. And it is right that Europe defends itself., Today in Kyiv, I discussed this topic with our friends – the President of Latvia and the Prime Minister of Poland, who arrived on a visit., Of course, the recommendations at the pan-European level are very important. However, there is legal scope to go further to do more. As the Baltic states and Poland did. A terrorist state can hardly be regarded as a source of tourism or any business visits., We also talked today about our bilateral cooperation with EU countries. In particular, this concerns the mitigation of procedures at our border. We must remove the barriers that still hinder our citizens and companies. Peoples who together defend European freedom should be as close as possible., It is known that there are certain difficulties and queues at the Ukrainian-Polish border. I discussed this with the Polish Prime Minister today – we agree on how to solve this problem., The Prime Minister of Ukraine and his Polish counterpart will agree on all technical details. So today, we discussed the issue of joint customs control, expansion of border crossing points, facilitation of postal exchange between Ukraine and the EU countries - I turned to Mr. Prime Minister of Poland with a proposal to lower the price of postal items. This is important for our people, for everyone who needs special support now., And one more important aspect: Poland asked us to help in the energy sector, in particular with the export of electricity. Of course, we will provide it. We will always help the Polish brothers who have been helping us since the first day., Two more plaques appeared on our Alley of Courage in Kyiv today – with the names of Mr. Levits, the President of the Republic of Latvia, and Mateusz Morawiecki, the head of the Polish government., We will gradually note all the leaders of politics, culture, sports and business, who personally visited Kyiv during the most difficult half-year from February 24 to August 24, and personally participated in the defense of our state., Today, I had the honor of presenting state awards to representatives of the media who were honored on the occasion of Independence Day this year., These are reporters, operators, producers, editors, and presenters... They all made a significant contribution to our victory in the media confrontation with Russia, to break through Russian propaganda and spread simply the truth about the war, about our independence., A moment of silence was observed for representatives of the media whose lives were taken by this war. As of today, they are 38 people – not only citizens of our country, but also foreigners who came to Ukraine for the truth and died from Russian weapons., Our army, intelligence, the Security Service of Ukraine continue active actions in several operational areas. They continue successfully., I want to once again appeal now to some bloggers, who are sometimes in a hurry to announce the results of certain active actions of our troops on the front lines... Please do not hurry with the reports, do not complicate the task for our army with your haste. Please do not report the specific details of the defense operation earlier than the official representatives of our state will say about it., At this time, the Armed Forces of Ukraine liberated and took control of more than 30 settlements in Kharkiv region. In part of the villages of the region, actions to check and secure the territory continue, we are gradually taking control of new settlements - everywhere we are returning the Ukrainian flag and protection for all our people., I am asking Ukrainians from the liberated territory: please give the representatives of our forces any information known to you about the crimes of the occupiers on Ukrainian land., Units of the National Police are returning to the liberated settlements of Kharkiv region., And I want to thank today our intelligence, our secret services, who once again showed themselves very effectively in throwing the enemy out., Many thanks to the soldiers of the 14th separate mechanized brigade named after Prince Roman the Great – the commander in the Kharkiv direction especially noted the heroic actions of the guys from this brigade., We do not forget about other directions. Fierce battles continue both in Donbas and in the south of our country., I'm thankful to the Marines of the 503rd Battalion for their courage in Donetsk region., My thanks to the intelligence of the 131st Separate Reconnaissance Battalion who, risking their lives, are the first to come forward and ensure the performance of the assigned tasks by the combined military units in Kherson region., I'm thankful to all our boys and girls, men and women who are fighting for Ukraine!, I signed new decrees on awarding our soldiers. 293 combatants were given state awards., And today in Kyiv I held a meeting with Haluk Bayraktar - a person whom Ukrainians do not need to introduce. The context of the meeting is clear, and the results will be clear. We are strengthening our state., I presented Mr. Bayraktar with the Order of Merit of first class – it was truly deserved., Glory to everyone who helps us!, Glory to Ukraine!"
8 September 2022  - 22:11 ,"In total, more than a thousand square kilometers of the territory of Ukraine have been liberated since the beginning of September - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Ukrainians!, It is with deep sadness that I learned of the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. A great loss for all of Europe, for the world. On behalf of the people of Ukraine, I extend condolences to the Royal Family, the entire United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. Our thoughts and prayers are with you., US Secretary of State Antony Blinken paid a visit to Kyiv today. We held negotiations very useful for both our countries, as we are making a common cause, defending freedom. I thanked the Secretary of State for his personal role in helping us; President Biden – for the decisive and effective leadership; the US Congress – for the unwavering bipartisan and bicameral support, and every American – for their sincere understanding of our struggle., We have President Biden's decision on a new $675 million defense aid package. It was also announced that Ukraine will receive more than a billion dollars from the general package of support for European democracies. Each of these steps of our partners has a real impact on the strength of our state and the whole of Europe in defense against Russian terror., As always, the range of topics at the negotiations with Mr. Secretary of State was wide. We discussed political cooperation, our interaction in the financial sphere - macroeconomic support is now as important as support with weapons and ammunition. Of course, attention was paid to the Fast Recovery Plan and, in general, to the reconstruction of Ukraine after the Russian strikes., I’ve raised the issue of officially designating Russia a terrorist state. The legal reality must always correspond to the actual reality. And it is a fact that Russia has become the biggest source of terrorism in the world. You can choose one or another format of procedures, one or another formula of legal pressure against Russia for terror, but the world must receive an unequivocal signal that Russian terror will not be forgiven., I continue to establish new ties for Ukraine - I had a conversation with the President-elect of Kenya, the first conversation in the history of relations between our states. I congratulated him on winning the elections, and we agreed to enhance cooperation. We also talked about overcoming the food crisis - we are doing everything for this., Just today, four ships with agricultural products for Asian countries left our ports. At these hours, more than 65 thousand tons of wheat enter the port of Sudan for unloading. Yesterday, a bulker with wheat departed for Kenya - more than 50 thousand tons. Vessels for Lebanon and Libya are now being loaded in Odesa. In the Pivdennyi Port, a ship bound for India is waiting to be loaded... That is, the geography of Ukrainian agricultural exports by sea is very broad., Literally every working day of the grain export initiative refutes Russian lies about it. Ukraine supplies agricultural products to consumers from different continents. And it is our supply that guarantees food security at the global level., I held a new meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. First of all, regarding our active actions on the frontline. Within the ongoing defense operations, our heroes have already liberated dozens of settlements. And today this movement continued, there are new results., In total, more than a thousand square kilometers of our territory have been liberated since September 1. I am grateful to everyone who made it happen! I am grateful to the army, intelligence officers, and special services for every Ukrainian flag that has been hoisted these days., We listened to the reports of the commanders of operational areas at the meeting today, there are certain decisions. The Staff will continue its work in the format of such fairly frequent meetings, so that our commanders on the ground have full support at all levels and so that the Armed Forces of our country, intelligence and the entire defense and security sector receive all the necessary resources, all the necessary material, political, information, diplomatic and any other means for the effective defense of Ukraine and the expulsion of the occupiers., All state activity is focused on the needs of the front and protection of our people., I am grateful to all Ukrainian warriors, to all those who fight for freedom for our people - both in the south and in the east, those participating in the battles at the front and those who contribute to our victory with respective operations in the rear of the enemy. The liberation of our land is the merit of everyone who clearly and timely fulfills the general defense plan., And I especially want to thank today the fighters of the 115th separate territorial defense brigade of the Operational Command ""North"", who distinguished themselves with bravery and the necessary results for Ukraine in the battles in February-March, when they stopped the advance of the enemy, and who continue to defend our state in the north direction. I am also grateful to the fighters of the 117th separate territorial defense brigade operating in the direction of Sudzha - Sumy, and the 1st tank brigade, which is firmly holding its position in the direction of Gomel - Horodnya., We remember all the threats, we thank all our heroes. I want to once again call on those who inform the society, who comment on the military situation: please analyze the whole picture, express gratitude and support to all our defenders, do not forget about any of them., Eternal glory to all those who stood up for the defense of Ukraine!, Eternal glory to our indomitable people!, Ukraine is and will be free!, Glory to Ukraine!"
7 September 2022  - 22:33 ,This week we have good news from the Kharkiv region; I think every citizen feels proud of our warriors - address by the President of Ukraine,", Ukrainians!, From now on, every year on September 7, Ukraine will celebrate Military Intelligence Day - a professional holiday of people whose contribution to our defense and future victory cannot be overestimated. Previously, we did not have such a holiday specifically at the state level, although military intelligence officers usually received congratulations on this day. I signed a decree that brings this day to a proper level., In the morning, I congratulated our intelligence officers, thanked them for their service, thanked Kyrylo Budanov, Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, for the results Ukraine needs. Presented state awards to the best intelligence officers. And I believe that I will repeatedly award representatives of the intelligence community of Ukraine for their achievements, for operations that continue constantly, and for successes that help our Armed Forces and the entire state move towards the liberation of our entire land., This week we have good news from the Kharkiv region. Probably, you all have already seen reports about the activity of Ukrainian defenders. And I think every citizen feels proud of our warriors. It is a well-deserved pride, a right feeling., Now is not the time to name the settlements to which the Ukrainian flag returns. But it's time to say thank you to the 25th airborne brigade, the 92nd separate mechanized brigade and the 80th airborne assault brigade for their bravery and heroism shown during combat missions., I also express gratitude today to the 406th separate artillery brigade for the extremely successful hits in the areas where the occupiers are concentrated in the south of our country and to the 60th separate infantry brigade, which consistently advances our positions., Each success of our military in one direction or another changes the general situation along the entire frontline in favor of Ukraine. The more difficult it is for the occupiers, the more losses they have, the better the positions of our defenders in Donbas will be, the more reliable the defense of Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and the cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region will be, the faster we will be able to liberate the Azov region and the entire south., I want to say one more thing today - it is very important and very sensitive. This applies to Ukrainians held captive by the occupiers. At the level of Ukrainian intelligence and other involved structures and people, we are constantly trying to achieve the liberation of our prisoners of war. This work never stopped. And the active actions of our defenders also mean the possibility of capturing a sufficient number of enemies to encourage the exchange and release of Ukrainian prisoners of war., I emphasize: we remember all our people held captive by the occupiers., An important decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine was made today. Sanctions have been applied to 606 individuals who belong to the ruling elite of Russia., 28 members of the Security Council of Russia, 154 members of the Federation Council of Russia, 424 deputies of the State Duma of Russia. They are all responsible for this war, for the terror against our people. And none of them will avoid responsibility - it's only a matter of time. We have already taken some of the necessary legal, diplomatic and political steps for this responsibility for them. We also take all other steps deliberately., Today, an important operation was carried out by the Security Service of Ukraine - regarding the activities of some persons subject to sanctions on the territory of our country. I have repeatedly emphasized: there will be no place for smugglers and criminal networks in Ukraine. It seems that some of them did not understand. Well, they will understand., The customs officials who helped the smugglers, including the leadership, have been removed from office and will receive a legal response for all their illegal actions., As for those persons subject to sanctions, who also have foreign citizenship, in particular Russian and Romanian, based on the proposal of the Security Service of Ukraine and in accordance with the norms of the current legislation, I made a decision to terminate the Ukrainian citizenship of these persons., I’ve held a meeting with the head of the government, the minister of finance, the relevant deputy head of the Office regarding the draft budget for the next year. It is clear that this will be the budget of a warring country. Government officials will present the parameters of the project, but I will now mention some important points - politically important points., First. More than a trillion hryvnias will be allocated to the security and defense sector next year. That will be priority number one., Second. Social obligations must be provided in full. In particular, I want Ukrainian pensioners to hear me: next year, as well as this year, the government is tasked with indexing pensions for all our pensioners., Third. To withstand this period and ensure financial and social stability, it is necessary to reduce as much as possible all non-critical expenses of the state, all that does not help defense, does not help the economic development of the country, social and cultural provision of our people. Accordingly, the government should present a program to reduce expenditures on the state enterprises, on the apparatus, on the institutions that do not meet the needs of this special time. I am waiting for proposals from government officials., Fourth. This is the intensification of economic relations. The lending program ""5-7-9%"" is maintained. There will also be other programs and solutions that should help businesses work, save jobs and attract new employees., And fifth. A special recovery fund will be established, which will be filled, in particular, at the expense of confiscated Russian assets., I expect that the draft budget will be submitted to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on time, as required by law., I spoke today with German Chancellor Scholz. Many topics: the responsibility of the terrorist state, the further strengthening of the defense capabilities of Ukraine, and the financial support for our state., I thanked Mr. Chancellor for confirming the €5 billion macro-financial aid from the European Union. This is an important decision. A decision that will enable us to support Ukrainians and provide social payments for our people. I also thank the European Commission and all our partners in the EU for this financial package. The provision of another three billion euros is being discussed, we are waiting for the format of the decision., The implementation of the grain export initiative, which is an important tool for our economy and for all partners of our state, continues. Ukrainian food was exported to three continents. To Africa, Asia and Europe. In detail, 54 vessels have already been sent to Asia, 16 vessels have already been sent to Africa, 32 vessels have already been sent to Europe, and part of this volume, by the way, is again sent to Asian and African countries afterwards., Today Russia voiced another blatantly false statement that the absolute majority of Ukrainian grain is allegedly exported to European countries. Well, words of truth have not been heard at the official level in Russia for a long time, and this does not surprise anyone., By the end of this month, at least 3 million tons of agricultural products can be exported from our seaports. And a significant part is for the poorest and most needy countries. In particular, the first cargo was delivered to Ethiopia. The route was not easy: first by sea, then by trucks. But hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians are actually saved from starvation., Perhaps Russia is not OK with this and does not want to notice it. However, this is exactly what the world needs. It is necessary to save countries on different continents from chaos, it is necessary to save people from starvation., Unlike Russia, we do not make a racist division of the world into those who deserve security and those who supposedly do not, into those who deserve to live without famine and those who supposedly do not. We support all people, all countries. Both those who help us and those who still refrain from helping us. Both those that are more stable and those that are less stable. I emphasize once again: Ukraine was, is and will be the guarantor of world food security., I am thankful to everyone who defends our country!, I am thankful to each of our partners who help us fight for freedom!, Glory to Ukraine!"
6 September 2022  - 23:27 ,Europe is not a place for promenade for Russian murderers and those who support them – address by the President of Ukraine,", Ukrainians! , We’ve got important events today., The European Union has taken a significant step in the visa issue regarding the citizens of Russia. The European Commission has approved a proposal to suspend the simplified visa regime currently in force between the EU and Russia., Of course, this is not yet a complete visa ban. But this already demonstrates to the citizens of the terrorist state that they bear certain moral responsibility for their state's aggression against Ukraine and the whole of Europe., There is such a situation now, when it is inadmissible to remain silent. And it is inadmissible not to oppose terror. It is absolutely unacceptable that European territory can be used for tourism or shopping by those who at home, in Russia, not only support the split and mockery of Europe, but also work for it. And it cannot be taken lightly that Russian propagandists can still stay in European countries, lie daily in reports and broadcasts from European capitals. Lie about Europe! Humiliate Europe! And at the same time be in Europe. An absurdity that must be stopped immediately., I am grateful to Mrs. President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and to all European leaders who support visa restrictions for Russian citizens., And we must remember: in addition to the moral side of the issue, it is also a matter of elementary security. Russia has repeatedly sent killers to Europe under the guise of ordinary tourists. They have already admired enough the spire in Salisbury, German streets and warehouses with weapons in the Czech Republic. Enough. Europe is not a place for promenade for murderers and those who support them., The second important piece of news is the IAEA report. The mission, which visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, presented a documentary summary of its work. The report notes the presence of Russian military equipment on the territory of the NPP, emphasizes pressure on our nuclear specialists, and makes clear references to the Russian military occupation. That's good., As for IAEA Director General Grossi's proposal to create a protection zone at the plant, we need to look at the specific content of such an instrument: what exactly can be the protection? If the content of this proposal is to demilitarize the territory of the nuclear power plant - and this is logical, as it was the Russian military presence that put the Zaporizhzhia plant on the brink of a radiation disaster - then we can support such a demilitarized protection zone., In any case, I believe that modern international organizations need a much broader mandate for their actions. I believe that the world not only deserves, but also needs the representatives of the IAEA to force Russia to demilitarize the territory of the NPP and return full control to Ukraine., If Russia puts the world on the brink of a radiation disaster, the world must have adequate means to put Russia in the conditions where the terrorist state will be forced to stop the terror., I took part in a number of important economic events in New York today - our government delegation led by First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko is there., Resistance to Russian terror and protection of our state take place at different levels. Defense goes hand in hand with diplomatic efforts, information work and, of course, the economy., Saving and creating new jobs in Ukraine, attracting investments and business projects, expanding logistics capabilities, protecting our needs for financial assistance - all this is absolutely necessary. And it is necessary now - when the war is still ongoing., One of the most famous stock exchanges in the world, the New York Stock Exchange, is one of the best places to attract the world's economic attention to Ukraine. And today was a Ukrainian day at the stock exchange. And this Ukrainian day started a global campaign to promote our economic potential. We will do everything to ensure that the world's leading businesses work with Ukraine and in Ukraine. It is obvious that the key challenge here is security. We are constantly improving our ability to respond to this challenge - to protect our state and our people., Today I want to thank the warriors who distinguished themselves in this., Five out of six Russian Kh-101 missiles were shot down only in the first half of the day. This is an expensive loss for Russia - and it saved many Ukrainian lives., Four of these missiles were shot down by servicemen of the Air Command South. Well done, guys!, Also, special thanks today to the warriors of the 79th airborne assault brigade, who heroically repel the enemy in the Donetsk direction., By the way, today I want to address all our people who create an information picture - in one way or another. Please draw your attention and the attention of society to the fact that the fierce confrontation continues almost along the entire frontline. This is one thousand three hundred kilometers of active hostilities. And it is simply unfair, when there are a lot of talks about certain areas of the front, while others seem to be forgotten. Although our warriors in many directions are doing an absolutely great job, they are absolute heroes., In Donbas, in the Kharkiv region, in the Zaporizhzhia region, in the south, in the border regions of the north and east of the country. The defense of the whole state needs equally sincere and serious attention., I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief - we are solving all issues related to the advance of our Armed Forces and the destruction of the occupiers as quickly and accurately as possible. 50,000 Russian lives have already been lost in this completely senseless war for Russia. And the occupiers do not care about even such a level of losses., And we do care about every life of our heroes, our defenders. We do everything to protect the lives of Ukrainians. And I am grateful to the partners who help us with this., Today, my diplomatic day began at 8 am - with a conversation with Mrs. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives. As always, productive and very warm. We coordinated our steps to protect Ukraine and freedom as such from Russian aggression., In the afternoon, I spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte about increasing sanction pressure on Russia, about new defense and macro-financial assistance to our country. I am very grateful., I have just had a conversation with the new Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mrs. Liz Truss. It was her first conversation in her new status with a foreign leader - and it is a great honor for Ukraine., I congratulated Mrs. Prime Minister on the beginning of her work and I feel that we will be able to build a profound and productive relationship., Mrs. Prime Minister takes office at a time of great difficulties. Russian energy blackmail, constant efforts of the terrorist state to destabilize the political situation in Europe and the free world, constant Russian disinformation..., However, by maintaining our unity and working in full coordination, we can overcome this, too., We have discussed how to further increase the pressure on Russia, so that the price of aggression for it would constantly increase. And so that the defense support for our state would also constantly increase. I’ve heard very important words about our cooperation, future security guarantees for Ukraine, and about the reconstruction of our state. It is very important that Great Britain retains a leadership role in consolidating the free world and protecting freedom., I invited the Prime Minister to visit our country. And I am thankful for the firm confidence that Ukraine and the free world will definitely win in this war started by Russia., I am grateful to everyone who protects Ukraine and freedom!, Glory to Ukraine!"
6 September 2022  - 19:48 ,It is on Ukrainian land that the new center of economic growth in Europe will be - President's speech at the meeting with the heads of big businesses in the framework of the opening of the New York Stock Exchange,", Ladies and Gentlemen!, Thank you for your interest in Ukraine!, Today is the 195th day of Russia's full-scale invasion of our country. And today we are 195 times more confident in our independence than any time before this war., And it may sound paradoxical, but it is a fact., Ukraine does not for a single moment doubt itself, its future, its victory., Despite the fact that the enemy is still on our land, despite the fact that we still have a long way to go to liberate our entire territory. We have no doubt that it will happen., We already know the outcome of this war, and we are on our way to that outcome., I think you also feel this confidence of ours now, I believe that, at least, otherwise you would not waste your time on Ukraine., Today I want to talk to you about this feeling. About why any success story in Europe is now simply impossible without Ukraine - a story of both political and business success., They are possible only with Ukraine and in Ukraine., Let me provide some facts., First, the fact that we preserve and will preserve our independence is a fundamental factor of security for the entire region, for the entire east and center of Europe. The resilience of Europe depends on our resilience, and we have it., Just recall: when else was the European Union as united and capable of acting together as it is now, when else did we together with our partners - in particular with the United States of America, with President Biden - manage to unite Europe and the entire free world around the struggle for freedom, for our values, the values of freedom? We did an unprecedented thing. And this is not just a temporary thing, this is a fundamental factor., The struggle for our independence is a struggle for the right to stability, the right to security for all of us, for all of Europe., The second fact is that we are perfectly integrated with our region and will be fully integrated with the European Union. Ukraine has already obtained the status of a candidate for EU membership - this happened precisely during this war - and we will definitely obtain full membership., And not only geographically, economically or politically are we integrated with other European nations, but also in terms of values. It is very important. Ukrainians appreciate freedom, education and work. Appreciate in the same way as any developed society., Although our country is attributed to the group of developing countries, we already have all the foundations to become a developed country. It just takes time., Speaking purely about the economy, we already have very profitable logistics and trade relations with the EU market - and these are duty-free conditions. We also have special conditions for access to the markets of Great Britain, Canada and Japan. We have traditional and very strong ties with the United States market., Without our agricultural exports, it is impossible to imagine stability in the markets and in general in many countries, primarily in Asia and Africa, and this was proven by the Russian blockade of our ports - when our agricultural sector stopped, dozens of countries found themselves on the verge of starvation. Now we are re-establishing export links, including by virtue of new routes and partial restoration of traditional sea exports - millions of tons of Ukrainian food are already being exported again, again by sea., The third fact is that we have an almost complete range of natural resources and minerals. From gas to uranium, from lithium to titanium, from coal to quartzite and much more. And we have not only resources, but also a strong culture and tradition of extraction, processing and production. We have qualified people. We have a developed transport sector and convenient logistics - with access to the European Union market., By the way, one of the reasons why Russia started a war of aggression against Ukraine is their apprehension that we will become not just an industrial competitor for Russia, but a real substitute for it in many markets of many countries., The fourth fact is that Ukraine can and, I am sure, will definitely become a green energy hub for Europe., We are capable of replacing dirty Russian energy resources. Ukraine has a huge natural potential for establishing capacities in green energy and in the production of green hydrogen. This is a potential of at least tens, and realistically looking at things – hundreds of gigawatts of green electrical power., Look at the situation in the European energy market - this market desperately needs a player like Ukraine. Of course, we have already started exporting electricity to the EU. It is a very important factor that it happened during the war. We export, but the scale of cooperation can be hundreds of times larger - imagine the profit for each participant in the energy business., The fifth fact is that we have already started the implementation of the project of reconstruction of Ukraine after hostilities. At this stage, this is the Fast Recovery Plan, which allows us now to restore everything that is needed in the liberated territory urgently: social, educational infrastructure, heat supply, transport., But the general project of Ukrainian reconstruction will be the largest economic project in Europe of our time. The largest for several generations. Its volume is already estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars. And with the necessary modernization of the Ukrainian infrastructure, taking into account security needs, it is more than a trillion dollars and in a fairly short term - less than ten years. No company will find such opportunities anywhere else in the world as in Ukraine. Your companies will not find anywhere else such opportunities as in Ukraine., Our government delegation headed by First Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Economy Yulia Svyrydenko is present in New York. Mrs. Svyrydenko and other members of the delegation will be able not only to answer your questions about opportunities in Ukraine, but also to present industries and projects for investment., Infrastructure funds will find a large number of projects in the airports and in the construction of new roads and bridges. Real estate funds will receive a market with hundreds of millions of square meters of new housing, offices, logistics, and industrial real estate. Banks and financial institutions can enter the huge lending market for all these projects in Ukraine. Insurance companies will be able to offer new insurance products, taking into account the specifics of our region and our risks. Hotel operators will be able to reveal our great tourist and business potential - the whole world is interested in seeing Ukraine, feeling it and being here., And I encourage you to plan your investment now. Without waiting for us to reach our victory., Pay attention - today about 80 percent of our territory is free from the enemy. Our warriors, our people are constantly increasing this figure. Moving towards victory every day. But victory is not only a military way, it is also an economic way. Our business makes its contribution. Our business is functioning. And most of Ukraine is already willing to implement new business projects., You all know very well that preparation for the implementation of any business project takes time. Time for team building, market analysis, site purchase, design, permitting procedures, etc. The preparation period is always a minimum budget, but a lot of time. Time that is spent while others could already start working. Therefore, start now - to be the first., We have hundreds of thousands of qualified young engineers and IT specialists, and this Ukrainian industry is world-renowned. We have an extremely favorable tax regime for IT. Taking into account all economic and logistical factors, we are a uniquely advantageous location for the offices of technology companies., Deploying production in Ukraine - from metal to pharmaceuticals, from mechanical engineering to agricultural products, you get advantages that you will not find in any other country next to the European Union market., Perhaps some of the companies whose representatives are here now or companies related to you are still working on the Russian market - and not just selling, but producing there. The prospect for all businesses is that they will have to leave Russia in any case. And therefore, it is profitable to come to Ukraine. It is on Ukrainian land that the new center of economic growth in Europe will be., You may ask me: how can you come to Ukraine now, as the war is still ongoing? I will answer you: any company that will have an opportunity to put the Made in Ukraine label on its product will automatically become a part of the story of Ukrainian bravery and victory, a globally known story, and at the same time - a part of our life, which we defend with all our strength - and with the help of the strongest world powers and leaders., Glory to Ukraine!"
5 September 2022  - 22:10 ,The shelling of the territory of the ZNPP means Russia does not care what the IAEA says and what the international community decides - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today, the Prime Minister of Great Britain and a great friend of our people, Boris Johnson, is leaving his office. But I believe that he will not leave political activity and will continue to support the defense of freedom in Ukraine, in Britain and around the world., I spoke to him today. As always, it was a very good conversation. It is usually said that there is no friendship in politics, but Boris is the case when you understand each other with half a word, when friendship exists, when it is strong and when it really strengthens both our states., From the first minutes of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine and Europe, Boris was with us. His first and most important question was always: How else can I help?, And I want to emphasize: even before February 24, we always felt that Britain stood with Ukraine. In a few years, we really managed to bring Ukrainian-British relations to the highest level throughout the entire time of our independence. This is an unprecedentedly high level. We have signed a very ambitious Political, Free Trade and Strategic Partnership Agreement. We have done a lot to strengthen the ties between our societies - economic, social, cultural. We have launched a program to renew the Ukrainian fleet. And now, during a full-scale war, we have agreed on the specific participation of Britain in the program of rebuilding Ukraine after hostilities., Today I thanked Boris on behalf of all Ukrainians, and I am sure that this is truly a multi-million Ukrainian ""thank you"". I am already looking forward to continuing our cooperation with Boris in his new status., And I am no less looking forward to the start of cooperation with the new Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mrs. Liz Truss. We in Ukraine know her well - she has always been on the bright side of European politics. And I believe that together we will be able to do a lot more to protect our nations and to thwart all Russian destructive efforts. The main thing is to preserve our unity, and this will definitely be the case., Today I also spoke with President of France Emmanuel Macron, for more than an hour and a half. Very meaningful negotiations. First of all, about the situation at the front, about defense support for Ukraine. I am grateful to Mr. President and all the people of France for their unwavering striving for the protection of our common European values, our common united Europe., Separately and in great detail, we have focused on the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. We exchanged views on the results of the IAEA mission to the plant - by the way, the conclusions of the mission are to be presented tomorrow. I hope they will be objective., All the more so, today the last power transmission line connecting the plant to the energy system of Ukraine was damaged due to another Russian provocative shelling. Again - this is the second time - due to Russian provocation, the Zaporizhzhia plant is one step away from a radiation disaster., I consider the fact that Russia is doing this right now, right on the eve of the IAEA conclusions, very eloquent. Shelling the territory of the ZNPP means that the terrorist state does not care what the IAEA says, it does not care what the international community decides. Russia is interested only in keeping the situation the worst for the longest time possible., This can be corrected only by strengthening sanctions, only by officially recognizing Russia as a terrorist state - at all levels., Ukraine has a very clear, transparent and honest position: while we controlled the plant, there was no threat of a radiation disaster. As soon as Russia came, the worst scenario imaginable immediately became possible. This requires an international response - from the UN to every normal state., The Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to consistently, very thoroughly and accurately destroy warehouses, bases, crossings, headquarters of the occupiers. The Russian army entered the territory of Ukraine without expecting resistance. And it will run away from here having no other hope of salvation., And I want to once again thank all our defenders, our intelligence, the Security Service of Ukraine who are doing everything to make it more and more difficult for the occupiers to stay in Ukraine every day., I also want to thank all our people in the temporarily occupied territories who help our army destroy the objects of the invaders., And today I especially want to thank the warriors of one of our rocket artillery brigades, who with their accurate fire destroyed the very Russian depot from which the occupiers took S-300 missiles to bomb Kharkiv. MLRS is a good thing. Thank you, our heroes!, The occupiers will definitely get a response for today's missile attack on Kryvyi Rih, for the constant shelling of Zelenodolsk, shelling of Nikopol, the Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the Kharkiv region, the cities of Donbas and our entire territory., Eternal glory to all who defend Ukraine!, Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for the independence of our country!, Glory to Ukraine!"
4 September 2022  - 22:20 ,We will return freedom to Crimea and make the peninsula one of the most comfortable places in Europe - address by the President of Ukraine,", Ukrainians!, Today is the anniversary of the detention of the first deputy chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people, Nariman Celâl, by the occupiers in Crimea. He did not commit any crimes. The only thing he annoyed the occupiers with was the defense of his people and his country – Ukraine., Nariman Celâl took part in the work of the Crimea Platform last year. He arrived at the summit from Crimea and told the guests and participants what was really happening on the peninsula. Told about repression against all those who try to preserve their freedom and their culture. About the degradation of life in Crimea during the occupation. The Russian presence in our Crimea has turned it into one of the most dangerous and unfree places in Europe. And Mr. Celâl wanted to do everything to change this - to return normal life to Crimea, to return Ukraine., I believe that the Ukrainian flag and free life will return to Crimea again. We will liberate all our lands, all our people., The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence, special services are already taking the necessary steps for this. These steps can be heard. And everyone can see that the occupiers have already started fleeing Crimea. This is the right choice for all of them. We will return freedom to Crimea, to all our people in Crimea, we will return freedom to qırımlılar and we will definitely make Crimea one of the best, most comfortable places in Europe. Crimea deserves it., I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. Although it is Sunday, there are no days off during the war. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, the commanders of operational areas and the head of intelligence delivered reports. Those were good reports., And today I want to thank the warriors of the 63rd battalion of the 103rd territorial defense brigade who ensured the result in the Donetsk region: the settlement was liberated., The 54th brigade in the Lysychansk-Siversk direction also took good steps, advanced and regained certain heights., I would also like to mention the 42nd separate motorized infantry battalion - thanks to its heroic actions, two settlements in the south of our country were liberated., I am grateful to all of you, guys!, I spoke today with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. It was, as usual, a very meaningful, very useful conversation about all the aspects of our relations., I expressed gratitude for the support already provided and for the efforts to limit Russian excess profits from oil and gas. I called for speeding up the provision of financial aid to us, to Ukraine. New sanction steps were discussed. In particular, I believe that the eighth package of sanctions should provide for pan-European visa decisions regarding Russian citizens so that none of those involved in this war can enjoy European hospitality., If the citizens of Russia support terror against Ukraine, against the whole of Europe, if they silently watch the genocide in Ukraine, they should not be able to use Europe for entertainment and fun. This is an important moral thing. Europe is a land of values, not Disneyland for supporters of terror. And visa restrictions will definitely demonstrate this. The free world must call the Russians to action - to action against those who started this war., By the way, it is the same as with the gas issue. Ukraine has repeatedly warned Europe that maintaining ""Nord Stream"" ties with Russia will be a problem that can turn into a disaster at any moment. That's exactly what happened., Visa omnivorousness regarding citizens of the aggressor state, financial ties with Russia, energy dependence on Russia are all things that Moscow uses against Europe., And I am grateful to those European leaders who are aware of the level of the threat., A very important aspect of today's conversation with Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen is the ability of the European Commission to carry out a rapid assessment as soon as we implement all its recommendations. We work every day for Ukraine's accession to the EU!, And every day we do everything to return our flag to our entire territory invaded by the occupiers. I am grateful to all our warriors who are holding and moving our positions forward! I am grateful to everyone who helps the defense of Ukraine! Together we will win!, And finally. Today I received a report that two people who were directly involved in the tragic incident in Chernihiv were detained on suspicion of committing a criminal offense. The one who gave the order to bring combat weapons to a public city event. And the one who allowed the child to take the weapon in hands. Criminal proceedings are carried out by the State Bureau of Investigation., Once again, I warn all representatives of the authorities and law enforcement agencies on the ground: make sure that there are no combat weapons or other dangerous items at public events., People's lives are the joint responsibility of everyone who must guarantee safety., Glory to Ukraine!"
3 September 2022  - 21:20 ,Russia prepares for energy attack on Europeans in winter; answer should be our unity and increased pressure – address of President of Ukraine,", Dear Ukrainians!, Today, our Air Force has a good result – downed Kaliber missiles, an attack helicopter of the occupiers, drones., I want to thank all our defenders of the sky from the East air command. Well done, today and always., Each such result is a saved life of our citizens, an opportunity not to be afraid for all our people. We will do everything so that Ukraine can fully defend its skies from Russian missiles and aviation. This is one of the fundamental issues for our country., And, of course, we are grateful to all our partners who help with the answer to this difficult question. Helping Ukraine with air defense is the most literal, most obvious way to protect people from Russian terror., Fierce fighting continues in many areas of the front – both in Kharkiv region, in Donbas, and in the south of our country., Russian troops again attacked Mykolaiv region, the districts of Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk regions, and Kharkiv. Unfortunately, there are victims, and among them, unfortunately, are children., Ukrainian artillery is doing everything to destroy the striking potential of the occupiers, so that every Russian headquarters and all their ammunition depots, all logistical routes in the occupied territory are neutralized., I thank our soldiers who ensure this. Today, in particular, the fighters of the 55th artillery brigade in the Donetsk direction merit special mention – for their accurate fire on the enemy. I'm grateful to our intelligence and the Security Service of Ukraine for the accuracy of our answers regarding the positions and objects of the occupiers., Unfortunately, today we have an absolutely unacceptable event in the city of Chernihiv. In the afternoon, an explosion rang out at a public event in the city center, and a grenade launcher went off. Children are among the victims. The little boy is now in serious condition in intensive care., The law enforcement officers should find out as soon as possible why this happened, who brought combat weapons to this city event. All those responsible must be brought to justice. And they will be., And I call on the representatives of local authorities throughout the country, all our law enforcement officers to be very careful so that this never happens again anywhere., These days, Russia is trying to increase the energy pressure on Europe even more – gas pumping through the Nord Stream pipeline has completely stopped. Why do they do this? Russia wants to destroy the normal life of every European – in all countries of our continent. It wants to weaken and intimidate the entire Europe, every state. Where Russia cannot do it by force of conventional weapons, it does so by force of energy weapons. It is trying to attack with poverty and political chaos where it cannot yet attack with missiles., And to protect against this, we all in Europe need even more unity, even more coordination, even more help to each other., This winter, Russia is preparing for a decisive energy attack on all Europeans. And the key answers to this should be two things: first, our unity – unity in protection against the terrorist state, and second – Increasing our own pressure on Russia – this includes increasing sanctions at all levels, and limiting Russia's oil and gas revenues., The more strikes we all make together, the fewer strikes these terrorists will be able to make., Thank you to everyone who defends our country!, Thanks to everyone who helps us!, Glory to Ukraine!"
2 September 2022  - 21:50 ,"Ukraine's movement to EU, transformation within the country is guarantee of freedom for all Ukrainians – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Dear Ukrainians! I wish you health!, Today, I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief this week. The heads of the defense and security sectors were present, as usual: Zaluzhny, Monastyrsky, Budanov, Maliuk, Danilov and others. The commanders of operational areas – Syrsky, Litvinov, Kovalchuk – reported on the state of affairs., I think that you all understand what the main questions are. Certain decisions have also been made. I think we will all see them. We also considered today the issue of supporting our military, comprehensive support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine., I held a meeting devoted to the state's further steps in European integration. This is another operational direction of our work – daily important work., For us, the movement of Ukraine to the European Union and the transformation within our country is one of the key elements of the long-term protection of the state, a guarantee of freedom for all Ukrainians. Therefore, the European integration process deserves not just separate attention to political, economic, social, and legal aspects, but a holistic approach. Moving towards Europe, we are strengthening Ukrainian national life as a whole. I am sure that Ukraine will become a full member of the EU. At least let's do everything for it., I took part today in the work of an important forum in Italy. One of the most influential economic forums in Europe is the Ambrosetti Forum. I thanked Prime Minister Draghi, all Italians who help us and also protect the Ukrainian desire for freedom, for Europe. He proposed new directions of cooperation between our states – now and after our victory., It is important for Ukraine to maintain and strengthen Italian support despite any changes in political attitudes. By the way, this week it was the second address to Italian society – after the address to the participants and guests of the Venice Film Festival., We are fighting for support and understanding of Ukraine in all European countries, in all audiences of European societies. I remind you every time that the protection of Ukraine is the protection of all of Europe. Not only ours, but the entire democratic world., It is from this point of view that it is worth considering the decision agreed today by the G7 countries to cap the price of Russian oil. When this mechanism is implemented, it will become an important element of protecting civilized countries and energy markets from Russian hybrid aggression., Indeed, the price of Russian gas must also be capped. I am grateful to Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, who said this today. It is long overdue for such energy sanctions against Russia. The sanctions that will not only limit the flow of petrodollars and gas euros to Moscow, but also, importantly, restore justice for all Europeans, whom Russia is trying to blackmail with artificially inflated prices on the energy market., I signed another decree on awarding our soldiers. 166 combatants were given state awards, 44 of them posthumously. Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine!, Eternal glory to all our soldiers who beat the invaders everywhere in Ukraine, on our land! The Kharkiv area, Donetsk region, the entire Donbas, the south, Crimea – Ukraine is and will be everywhere. That's it! There will be freedom. That's it! And there will be Europe. We will never give ours to the occupiers., Glory to Ukraine!"
2 September 2022  - 12:26 ,We will force Russia to peace if all our partners keep their word as Ukraine does - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Ambrosetti Forum,", Dear participants of the Forum!, Ladies and Gentlemen!, I am grateful for this opportunity to address you right now as we are all going through a very risky time in this war., I would like to start with a fact that you may have missed. But I ask you to pay attention to it., Pay attention to the fact that the work of the Forum is currently being monitored by independent media. As far as I know, representatives of such media as Corriere della Sera, Rai, La Repubblica, La Stampa, New York Times, Financial Times, Reuters, Fox Business Channel, CNBC Europe are present at the Forum. And I think many others. In general, 280 media representatives cover the Forum., We are open to all. And we are open to them. And I can't imagine that any of us are afraid of such or similar media., But I will tell you who is afraid of them., As you know, Ukraine is at the epicenter of Russian radiation blackmail right now. The Russian army seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant back in March and still holds it captive. This is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe - there are six nuclear reactors., The plant was repeatedly shelled. On the very first night, when the Russian occupiers entered there, on the night of March 4, they fired at the plant’s premises from tanks. There is video confirmation. Over the months after that, the situation has not changed - shelling and provocations every day, constantly., Under the cover of a nuclear plant, the Russian army is shelling neighboring cities and districts - this was the strategy. The occupiers are also shelling the plant itself - to put pressure on Ukraine and on all of you in Europe and on the world. The whole world. They want you to show weakness, to give up and stop supporting Ukraine. This is why Russia is doing this radiation blackmail., Recently, the Zaporizhzhia NPP was literally one step away from disaster - when the power transmission lines were damaged as a result of shelling, automation began to shut down the reactors. Only the Ukrainian nuclear engineers, who work there absolutely professionally even in such difficult conditions, manage to prevent the accident., If it was not for our professional people, Russia would have already provoked the worst disaster in the history of Europe - even worse than Chornobyl. And it is logical that this requires a strong international reaction., With the help of our partners, we ensured that the IAEA mission was sent to the plant - just yesterday the mission was there. We agreed with the head of the IAEA, Mr. Grossi, the members of the mission, when I met with them, that they would help with the key issue - the key issue of the safety of the nuclear power plant, the key issue is the demilitarization of the plant. Because this is key to protecting all of us, all Europeans, from a radiation disaster. We also agreed that together with the IAEA mission, independent journalists from Ukrainian and international media will arrive at the territory of Zaporizhzhia NPP. The same media that are currently covering this Forum., But what did we see? The Russian military stopped the journalists traveling with the mission at a checkpoint and did not let them go any further. Obviously, the occupiers felt that in the presence of a free media it would be impossible to lie to the IAEA and the whole world. Free media scares Russia., And this says everything at once - if you do not allow independent journalists to the plant, it means you are definitely aware of your responsibility for the catastrophe that the plant is on the verge of, and you are afraid that the world will draw conclusions about your responsibility., Unfortunately, the mission did not protect the journalists and did not put enough pressure on the Russians so that independent media would still be at the plant, so that everything would be open and fair there. And we talked about it with the mission and agreed. We said that without the admission of independent journalists, Russian propagandists would dominate the place. It would be a theater. Unfortunately, we also have not yet heard from the IAEA the key thing - the call to Russia regarding the demilitarization of the plant. And how can you do without it?, I really hope that the mission will adhere to what the parties have agreed upon and what is in the interests of the entire international community. The greatest risk of a radiation disaster in 40 years must be removed. It is impossible to leave the military of the terrorist state at the nuclear power plant. There are situations when the fate of everyone on the continent depends on keeping one's word. This is exactly the situation now., Ukraine has repeatedly demonstrated that we always keep our word. Always. This is evident in many areas., Of course, we did everything to ensure that the IAEA got access to the Zaporizhzhia NPP. I believe that this mission can still be fruitful., And also - this is another example - we have fulfilled our obligations for the grain export initiative, which alleviates the food crisis in the world. And therefore, it prevents a new migrant crisis. Famine in the countries of Africa and Asia would lead to new waves of migrants to Europe and, in particular, to the Mediterranean coast, to Italy. But we do everything for this not to happen., Ukrainian food has already reached 20 countries by sea. Our wheat was also sent to such countries as Ethiopia and Yemen, where the situation is particularly difficult. We will continue to keep our word on food safety guarantees., We are ready to help stop the price chaos in Europe. While Russia is making efforts to increase gas shortages on the market and prices, Ukraine is willing to increase electricity exports to EU countries. The return of the Zaporizhzhia plant to a safe mode of operation and its connection to the Ukrainian power grid is important particularly for this as well. The Russian presence at the plant significantly weakens our ability to help Europe in the energy sphere., At the expense of our electricity exports, we can stabilize the energy consumption of our neighbors in the EU, and as a result, this will reduce Russia's energy pressure on the whole of Europe, and therefore on Italy. Even now, despite all the difficulties, we can export such a volume of electricity that corresponds to at least eight percent of the consumption of the whole of Italy., Moreover, Ukraine can become a green energy hub for Europe, which will replace Russia's dirty energy resources. Dirty - in different senses of the word: both environmentally and morally. Our country has a huge natural potential for the development of capacities in green energy and in the production of green hydrogen. This is a potential of at least tens, and possibly hundreds of gigawatts of green electrical power and millions of tons of green hydrogen. It is important that there is already an infrastructure for transporting electricity and hydrogen to the EU. All this is there. And we have always kept our word on providing Europe with energy resources. Just compare it to the typical behavior of Russia, which always breaches treaties and uses the economy for political blackmail, not fulfilling its own promises., Even during a full-scale war, Ukraine did everything to gain the status of a candidate for EU membership. We quickly and efficiently fulfilled our obligations and we will do everything to start negotiations on EU membership. We will definitely be together with you in a united Europe. I am grateful to Italy and I am personally grateful to Prime Minister Mario Draghi for supporting our country on this European path and in protecting it from Russian aggression. Every word of our agreements with Mr. Draghi has been adhered to one hundred percent. A truly worthy person, truly worthy relations between our states., And life itself demonstrates that we need even more integration, even more agreements and results., We must ensure full compliance with every promise to increase pressure on Russia to finally stop the radiation blackmail, guarantee the complete safety of the Zaporizhzhia NPP and four other large nuclear facilities in Ukraine., All words regarding the support of Ukraine with weapons, shells and finances must be confirmed by actions as long as this war continues. Russia does not understand the words of peace. But it feels the strength on the battlefield very well., Strength should be with Ukraine, with the free world. Including the sanctions that the world applies as self-defense against Russian aggression. Strength should also be with business, primarily in Europe. The reputation of none of the companies will withstand radiation sickness. Therefore, it is necessary to immediately sever relations with the country that resorted to radiation blackmail. And don't wait for disasters to make decisions, switch to predictable partners. Ukraine is just such a partner., Of course, now it is the war. Of course, Russian missiles hit our land. We lose people every day. And I will remind you of just one terrible number - 379. This is the number of Ukrainian children killed by Russian strikes. More than 735 children were wounded. All together in Europe and in the free world we have the power to end this war. And therefore, over time, we can move to much more meaningful economic relations., Ukraine is already one of the world's largest producers of agricultural crops. You have already talked about this today. And together we can build one of the largest agro-processing clusters, strengthen our ability to be a guarantor of food security making Ukraine a place of production of affordable food for the whole world., Also, Ukraine is ideal for locating any processing enterprises. From woodworking to all types of mechanical engineering. We have a large amount of almost all resources and minerals - from gas to lithium, qualified people, fast logistics to the European market, good access to it. We want it, we strive for it., Ukraine is an ambitious reconstruction project after hostilities. Reconstruction worth hundreds of billions of euros - of everything that Russia destroyed with its terror. Tens of thousands of different objects have to be created virtually anew. And I am grateful to those Italian companies that have already shown their interest., And Ukraine is a completely new defense and security sector, whose power will match what we experienced in this war, and which will make a fundamental contribution to the security of Europe in the coming decades., Of course, after we force Russia to leave our land and make peace. And this will be possible if all our partners keep their word. Just as Ukraine does. Just as Italy does., I thank you for the firmness of the Italian word, for the actions that confirm that word. Thank you for supporting our state, for supporting our people who found refuge on your land. We will never forget it. I say this frankly, honestly, from the heart, from every citizen., Glory to Ukraine!"
1 September 2022  - 22:27 ,It is demilitarization of the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP that is the goal of Ukrainian and international efforts - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Ukrainians!, Today, a new academic year began in our country, as it should be. Despite everything. More than six months of full-scale war. Extraordinary destruction caused by the occupiers. But the education of Ukrainian children continues., It takes place in various formats, yet systematically and professionally everywhere. And I am grateful to all our educators who continue their work and guarantee with their attention to children that all young Ukrainians have an opportunity to become educated and live a decent modern life. More than 300,000 first-graders, almost 4 million pupils - this is the scale of September 1 this year., So, in addition to many other conclusions, a very important political conclusion can be made today - about the resilience of our state, about the strength of our society. Our educational institutions are effective. Our state and local communities ensure the restoration of education even in those areas where schools were destroyed during the occupation., Today I was in Irpin, Kyiv region. I saw the beginning of the work of such a restored school. 1,300 pupils will get their education there. The children went to the first grade, as is customary. I was happy to see them starting to study and to see the conditions it happens in. A good, comfortable, humanly warm school. And it will be the same on the entire territory of our state, which we will definitely oust the invaders from., No matter what they destroyed, we will restore everything, we will rebuild everything. No matter how much they want to destroy Ukraine and anything Ukrainian, our children will still go to their schools and universities and get an education absolutely freely. National education. Humanistic education. Education built not on lies and propaganda spread by the terrorist state, but on real knowledge, openness to the world and the best human values., Today, the IAEA mission arrived at Zaporizhzhia NPP. It's good that it happened. The fact itself despite all the provocations by the Russian military and the cynical shelling of Enerhodar and the territory of the plant. Ukraine did everything to make this mission happen. But it is bad that the occupiers are trying to turn this IAEA mission - a really necessary one - into a fruitless tour of the plant. I believe that this will be prevented., It is good that the IAEA representatives have an opportunity to draw objective conclusions about the risks that have arisen at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant for the first time in history. Moreover, the risks that have arisen precisely because of the occupiers. The main thing is to have the will to draw objective conclusions. Constant shelling, the presence of Russian military and weapons at the plant, tormenting Ukrainian personnel and attempts to put the plant under the control of Rosatom representatives who are not at all capable of a responsible attitude towards such an object... These are the reasons for the risks., We have clear evidence that Russia did a lot of cynical things to deceive the mission. In particular, with the help of intimidation of residents of Enerhodar. The occupiers forced people to lie to the IAEA representatives - to hand over some papers, sign something, say something., When we met with Mr. Grossi and members of the mission in Kyiv, we agreed that the mission would be accompanied by journalists from Ukrainian and international media. Independent journalists. For the world to see the truth. To see what is really happening. Unfortunately, this wasn’t done. Although it was promised. Unfortunately, the occupiers did not let the journalists in, but organized a bunch of their propagandists. Unfortunately, the IAEA representatives did not protect the representatives of independent media., We are hopeful that the mission will nevertheless draw objective conclusions from the circumstances at the plant. For more than three decades, 5 facilities have been under the control of our specialists - the Chornobyl plant and 4 operational nuclear power plants. The IAEA never had any claims regarding the activities of any of these facilities until Russia invaded our territory and brought its madness here., When the Russian military finally leave the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP, when they take away their weapons, ammunition, when they stop shelling Enerhodar and neighboring areas and cease their provocations, the Zaporizhzhia plant will be able to return to a completely safe functioning, which has always been the case under the control of Ukraine., And the key thing that should happen is the demilitarization of the territory of the plant. This is exactly the goal of Ukrainian and international efforts. And it is bad that we have not yet heard the appropriate calls from the IAEA. Although we talked about it with Mr. Grossi at our meeting in Kyiv. This was the key - the key! - security point of our agreements. It was clearly stated: demilitarization and full control by Ukrainian nuclear specialists., Today I had a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Denmark who arrived in Ukraine. I thanked him for the support, which is a very useful support, in particular in the field of defense. We discussed further steps to defend Ukraine and the entire united Europe, the sanction policy and the restoration of our state after hostilities., I held the first conversation with the new Prime Minister of Israel Lapid. I emphasized the necessity of Israel’s accession to the sanctions on Russia, sanctions for all the evil brought by this war. The evil that should have never returned again., I addressed the Polish people - September 1 is the anniversary of the beginning of World War II. I said an important thing in this address: just as that aggressor was defeated and convicted, this aggressor will inevitably be defeated and convicted as well. When the free world is united and the victim of aggression is not left alone, when no one signs disgraceful pacts with evil, the war ends with the victory of the forces of good., I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 155 combatants were awarded state awards, 22 of them posthumously. In total, since February 24, 28,042 Ukrainian warriors have received state awards. Those who heroically defend our state in all directions. Who ousted the enemy from the north, who are beating the occupiers in the east, who are destroying them in the south and, what is very important now, are working for the liberation of our Crimea., And today I especially want to express gratitude to our defenders in the Kharkiv direction - the 92nd brigade, all warriors and сommanding officer of the brigade Fedosenko. Thanks for your bravery guys!, And also to our Air Forces. Yesterday, the anti-aircraft troops in the Donetsk region did a very good job - shot down another helicopter of the occupiers, already the 205th during the full-scale war, and two UAVs. In total, more than 800 Russian drones have already been destroyed. Today, our Air Forces did a good job against enemy missiles - thank you for the result!, I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
1 September 2022  - 10:03 ,"We will do everything so that Ukrainians, Poles and all the peoples of Europe live freely – President of Ukraine addresses the people of Poland on the 83rd anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War",", Dear friends!, Dear Polish people, brothers and sisters!, Already 83 years separate us from that morning that put Europe and the world on the brink of ruin. On September 1, 1939, around 4 a.m., the Polish city of Wieluń was the target of a terrible bombardment. Nazi Germany went to war against all free nations, starting with Poland., And there will not be such a generation of Ukrainians, Poles, all Europeans or people in general who will forget what Nazism brought and what the Nazi executioners were held accountable for., People believed that it would be possible to avoid the repetition of those terrible crimes and such a cruel war. But it was such a morning again. Only on February 24, 2022, when bombs and missiles hit peaceful cities. Once again, the ideology of hatred is trying to seize space in Europe through mass murder and terror., Wieluń is repeated – in Kharkiv, in Mykolaiv, in the cities of Donbas, in Mariupol. Burnt cities and villages were repeated. Katyń was repeated – in Olenivka. The deportation was repeated., But there is something that did not happen again. No one made criminal pacts with hatred. And from the first minute of this war, we receive real help from true friends and brothers, who have become our powerful rear and are doing everything to help us win., We will do everything to ensure that Ukrainians, Poles and all the peoples of Europe live freely. So that every generation of our peoples, all Europeans and people in general remember what racism was and what the racist executioners will be punished for. We will do everything to ensure that the morning of September 1, the morning of June 22 and the morning of February 24 do not repeat. Never again. We will do everything so that hatred finally loses., Thank you for your support! Thank you, dear Andrzej, for your leadership! Glory to Poland! Glory to Ukraine!, Eternal memory to all innocent victims!"
1 September 2022  - 08:01 ,"""Knowing"" and ""defending"" always go hand in hand – President of Ukraine congratulates preschoolers, schoolchildren and students on the start of the new academic year",", Dear children!, Dear schoolchildren, students!, Dear children of Ukraine who are going to school for the first time today! Dear schoolchildren returning to school! Dear students who acquire professional skills! Dear friends!, Today, September 1st is your Day, an important day for all of us, the Day of Knowledge., This year's September 1st is very different from the thirty previous ones. But it still combines dozens of previous ones., Previous years, previous centuries. Battles that have been and battles that are going on. The victories that slipped away from our people, and the victories that the Ukrainians won, and the victory that will surely come., Today is the Day of Knowledge – the 190th day of knowledge. Knowledge that summarizes more than a thousand years of Ukrainian history, Ukrainian culture, Ukrainian life. Life – against all odds. Despite any threats., Despite enemy's aspirations that have always lost and will lose to our desire to live., Your desire. The desire to love and be friends, to develop and grow, to defend what was received from parents and learn new things. That is, to learn and get stronger., That's what makes this school year so special., It starts differently for everyone. Someone is far from home – in other regions of Ukraine. Someone is far from home – in other countries. Someone remotely – online. Someone is at their home school or at their university, but still – not at peace., However, it is important that the school year begins. It is important that learning continues. And that knowledge about Ukraine is not interrupted., Because this knowledge gives us strength. This knowledge has become our weapon., ""Knowing"" and ""defending"" always go hand in hand. To know more than a thousand years of history of our statehood and to defend when someone says that Ukraine did not exist. To know our geography – our beautiful land, our wonderful sea – and to defend not just the territory, but the incredible places where our identity was created at different times. To know our culture, to hear the Ukrainian word, because the answer is in our culture, in our literature, in our poetry., The answer of Shevchenko and Franko, Lesya Ukrainka and Stus, Symonenko and Honchar, Lina Kostenko and many others... The answer is why we will win.,  , The crystal-white night was pierced by the sound of rockets., The sky is all in a bloody wreath, in a wreath of fires.,  , How did the Ukrainians respond to this?, On February 24, we united. Everyone united. We stood up for defending the dearest thing that we have., And you showed yourself – our children.,  , We're warriors, not lazy, not lying down., And our cause is true and holy., Don't care what others are fighting for,, We're fighting for independence., That's why our lives are so hard.,  , Our children supported us, supported the state. They grew up very quickly. They did not get scared. And they helped. They helped – in bomb shelters. They took care of parents who were injured. They brought water and food – to the military. They raised money – to give to volunteers for the army., One can only be proud of Ukrainian children.,  , Be patient, be patient – patience you grind,, Steel your spirit - and be patient therefore, endure., No one will save you from troubles., No one will knock you off your own track., Stand on it. To death. Firmly., As long as light and sun, stand and wait., Pave your way – the one that you identified yourself,, The one who chose you forever and ever., You have committed yourself to it since childhood,, The Lord himself doomed you to it.,  , This summer - no one had a summer. Time passed, as if from winter to winter., Instead of playgrounds, it was possible to be in basements. Instead of playing football in the street, children had to stay with adults and hear too much tragic news., But you were brave. And you made your choice – a choice in favor of Ukraine., Entire Ukraine – from Uzhgorod to Yalta, from Chornomorsk to Kharkiv. For the benefit of all our people.,  , My Nation exists, and my Nation will always continue to exist!, Nobody will scratch out my nation!, All renegades and strays will disappear., And so will the hordes of conquerors-invaders!, And it was a lesson for them,, When the whole world could see,, As if in millstones, our strong hands, Ground the barbarian horde.,  , We all know that victory will come. You all know that there will be victory. They stole part of your childhood, part of your youth... But you are free. You always will be. So be worthy of your will – and of our Ukraine.,  , And everyone holds heavy iron hammer,, And loud voice from top like thunder booms:, ""Thou split this rock! Don't let no cold, nor heat, To stop you! Endure the drudgery, and thirst, and hunger,, Because you are to break this rock apart!"",  , And on the reborn earth, There will be no enemy, no tyrant, There will be a son, and there will be a mother,, And there will be people on the earth.,  , Today you go to school, begin your studies, continue getting an education. Today you are going to the opportunity to see, hear, know – Ukraine. Knowledge about it, words about it, dreams about it - which were all about you. About your life. Free, clean, brave and smart., Today, I cannot but congratulate our people for having such children in Ukraine., Glory to Ukraine!"
1 September 2022  - 00:25 ,"Russia wants the world to make three mistakes: to get used to the war, to put up with the war and to forget about the war; this intention should never succeed - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the Venice Film Festival",", Ladies and Gentlemen!, Dear participants and guests of the Venice Film Festival!, I appreciate the opportunity to address you today and tell our story. Tell about Ukraine, its people and the war that Russia has been waging against us for 189 days. A story that is beyond competition and beyond the limits of humanity and common sense. A drama based on real events. Embodied in life by real savages, murderers, torturers, terrorists. A tragedy accompanied not by Morricone's brilliant music, but by gruesome ditties and sounds of explosions, gunshots and air raid sirens. Horror, not 120 minutes but 189 days long. 189 days of war, which continues in Ukraine and which Europe and the world are allegedly tired of. This is what Russia claims. This is what Russia wants. A primitive plot in three acts for the world to make three dramatic mistakes. To get used to the war. To put up with the war. To forget about the war., This intention should never succeed. , Cultural figures, directors, producers, actors, screenwriters, DOPs, composers, artists, designers, film critics and thousands of other people - from different countries of the world and one cinematographic family. Your position is important, your voice is influential, your word is loud. The least you can do today, or rather, NOT do, is not to be silent, not to be afraid, not to turn away, not to pass by and not to be indifferent to the war in Ukraine, which was unleashed by Russia., Ladies and Gentlemen!, For someone, power is only missiles and nuclear warheads. For us, power is in philosophy, mentality, these are meanings and words. For us it is also a weapon. I want every country, every nation, every institution and community in the world to have a clear idea of what Ukraine is going through now., To hear about this war in the most understandable language. For you, this is the language of cinematography. But you won't see any scary footage now: explosions, gunshots, destruction, smoke, pain and tears. You will see things that most people don't usually see. An integral part of every film, which not everyone pays attention to. Important names that fade into oblivion and obscurity, because the moment they appear on the screen, most viewers do two things: stand up and leave. I know that the first thing today is important. The second is impossible., To be continued… To be continued?, The answer to this question today depends on all of us., Whenever someone talks about being tired of Ukraine, these titles should be mentioned. To get tired of Ukraine means to brush off these names. To forget these names., I am confident that the whole civilized world will never do this, will never give up, will stand with Ukraine to the end, to the victorious end, when truth and justice will hear applause!, Glory to Ukraine!"
31 August 2022  - 23:00 ,"On behalf of intelligence, I express gratitude to all our people in the south of Ukraine and Crimea for the information provided - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Ukrainians!, Today was a really busy day., I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. All relevant leaders were there: Zaluzhny, Monastyrskyi, Budanov, Maliuk, Danilov and others. I think it is obvious what issues we considered. The military reported on the situation on the frontline, on the development of the situation., I will not reveal the details now. I will say only one thing: on behalf of our intelligence, I want to thank all our people who support us very strongly in the south of our country, and especially in Crimea. The intelligence officers are grateful for the information provided and will use it to the maximum. Let the enemies not forget whose peninsula they are staying on. Temporarily staying., The fighting in Donbas remains fierce – the hot spots in the region have not changed. Our guys are holding their ground. I am grateful to every warrior for resilience!, Today I held a meeting with representatives of the Parliament and the Government of Ukraine regarding the current plans of the state’s work., I took part in the work of a very respectable forum in the Czech Republic, in Prague, called Forum 2000. It was founded by Václav Havel and is attracting significant attention in Europe., I addressed the participants of the forum and urged them to strengthen the support of our state in this war and the protection of all of Europe from Russian pressure. In particular, the issue of limiting European visas for citizens of Russia should be finally resolved., I think it is humiliating for Europe when it is considered as just one big boutique or restaurant. Europe is primarily a territory of values, not primitive consumption. And when the citizens of the state that wants to destroy European values use Europe for their entertainment or shopping, for the vacation of their mistresses while they themselves work for the war or to simply silently wait out the immoral fall of Russia, which is happening right now, this is completely contrary to everything which Europe was united for in general., The European Union was intended to maintain peace on the continent. Work for peaceful and democratic development of European countries. Europe cannot become morally deaf. And none of the European leaders will be able to justify the fact that the money allegedly doesn’t smell for them with the consequences of COVID., Because if there is such deafness, if there is such a loss of the ability to distinguish the smell of blood on bills, there will be no Europe, there will be no peaceful Europe., I am grateful to those Europeans who understand that in wartime it is the duty of any normal person to fight for the aggressor to lose, for the occupation to end, for the Russian military to leave Ukrainian land., Today I want to thank all our agricultural workers, port workers, diplomats and government officials who returned the status of a real guarantor of food security in African countries to Ukraine., 23 thousand tons of Ukrainian wheat under the UN World Food Programme have already arrived at the port of Djibouti. And they will be delivered to the people of Ethiopia, where there is the worst drought in the last 40 years and millions of people are on the verge of starvation., We are also restoring the relevant connections with the countries of the Arabian Peninsula - almost 40 thousand tons of wheat are headed to Yemen., And in general, more than 1.5 million tons of our food have already been exported by sea from the three ports that became operational thanks to the grain export initiative. We are doing everything for the world to feel the importance of Ukraine and be grateful to our people., I signed the decree on awarding our warriors today. 149 combatants were awarded state awards, 15 of them posthumously. We will always remember our heroes!, Eternal glory to all who fight for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
31 August 2022  - 20:17 ,The decisive battle for freedom is taking place in Ukraine now; we are grateful to you that we are not alone in this battle - President's address to the participants of the 26th annual Forum 2000 Conference in Prague,", Dear Mr. Prime Minister Fiala!, Dear participants of the Forum!, Ladies and Gentlemen!, I am grateful for the opportunity to address you today., Today is already the 189th day of the full-scale war of the Ukrainian people for freedom. And this is a war for freedom not only for our people. At different times and in different parts of the world, just such battles in which freedom either wins or loses take place. Not for one nation - for many. For many countries and for a long period of time., We all remember 1968. We remember how people then felt the desire for freedom, how they fought for freedom, and how a historic chance for freedom arose in the center of Europe for a huge space that was under the rule of tyranny at that time., That chance was destroyed by Soviet tanks in Prague. The world then did not feel the scale of this battle and what exactly was being destroyed. It did not feel what the result of victory would be, and did not want to see immediately what the defeat of freedom in this battle would lead to., Europe is still forced to overcome the consequences of the fact that tyranny managed to hold on for another 20 years at that time. Managed to hold on due to the fact that freedom did not get help. Did not get help to express itself to the fullest. Was not armed as it should have been. And due to the fact that people did not unite for its sake., What did it lead to? To death and suffering. To the wave of refugees. To the point that the countries of eastern and central Europe remained without freedom for more decades. And not only without political, cultural or personal freedom of people. But also without economic freedom, without many manifestations of normal social development. Only children and grandchildren were able to get the opportunities and well-being that should have been rightfully enjoyed by the generation of their parents who were young during the Prague Spring., But the most terrible thing is that the supporters of tyranny who lived at that time and who saw the destruction of freedom by tanks, all those who are annoyed by freedom, all those who despise the right of peoples to self-determination, just then got the illusion that freedom would lose to tanks., The illusion that it is just necessary to be cruel enough, to send a sufficient number of tanks, to intimidate the democratic world - and freedom will not endure and will inevitably fall., You hear exactly this illusion when the opponents of freedom say that it is necessary to more decisively suppress with tanks this or that protest, this or that uprising. When they say that it is just necessary to send more tanks to suppress the independence of this or that nation., This illusion caused a lot of evil after 1968. And this illusion is at the heart of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24., But right here, on our land, and right now, in our time, we have a historic chance to destroy this illusion!, In Ukraine, there is now a decisive battle for freedom. I am grateful to you that we are not alone in this battle. I am grateful for the support we have received. Grateful for the unity we maintain., I want to note the role of the Czech Republic in the protection of freedom - it is really significant. The personal involvement of Prime Minister Fiala and many representatives of your state is really important for us., We have already done a lot. Tyranny has felt that free nations know how to defend themselves, and that the victory of freedom is absolutely probable. This was achieved in different vectors of confrontation. From the frontline, where our Ukrainian warriors physically defend freedom, to the political sphere, in which we managed to achieve a historic result for the sake of Europe. Even in such a terrible time, Ukraine did everything necessary to obtain the status of a candidate for membership of the European Union. I am grateful to the people of the Czech Republic, your government and parliament for supporting us on the European path., However, the battle for freedom still continues!, The length of the frontline on Ukrainian soil is 2.5 thousand kilometers. Active hostilities - with the use of all possible types of weapons, except, fortunately, weapons of mass destruction - continue on a line of 1.3 thousand kilometers. Imagine this scale! It is like the road from Kyiv to Prague., Russia is throwing everything it has to the frontline. And it has a lot of weapons and ammunition left from the time of the Soviet Union. And the occupiers are not restrained by the norms of any conventions or even elementary humanity. They are brutally shelling our cities with artillery. Every day and every night, people die from these terrible shelling occasions, from missile and air strikes., The mass terror against the people in the occupied territory has reached a level that Europe had only seen during World War II from the Nazis., Russia is blackmailing Ukraine, Europe and the world with a radiation disaster at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Think about it! No enemy of humanity has ever resorted to such blackmail - turned a nuclear power plant into a battlefield., Therefore, we all need to do a lot more together to win this battle for life., Ukraine needs constant and sufficient support with weapons and ammunition. So that we can not only hold the frontline, but also expel tyranny from our land, finally destroy its plans to subjugate Ukraine and anyone else in Europe., We also need financial support, and all leaders of the free world, heads of European structures are aware about this need. Winning a war requires financial stability., The world has already armed freedom in this battle against tyranny with powerful sanctions against Russia. But the potential of the terrorist state has not yet been destroyed by these sanctions. Russia still hopes that it will adapt to the sanctions and be able to withstand the pressure of the free world. Therefore, new sanctions packages are needed. From everyone - without exception., Rosatom and the entire nuclear industry of Russia must face blocking sanctions for radiation blackmail at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Russian nuclear scientists are working to repeat the Chornobyl disaster - this must be punished. Before it's not too late. Thanks to sanctions, all potential aggressor states in the world should see that the price of radiation blackmail will be unbearable for the blackmailer., It is necessary to finally completely block the Russian banking system. How much can we talk about it? It is absurd that Russian banks can still work with the world financial system, as the Russian state is doing everything to cause the world as much damage as possible!, We have already mitigated the acuteness of the food crisis provoked by Russia. Likewise, we must do everything to alleviate the energy crisis, due to which Russia is trying to destroy our unity and ability to defend ourselves., Russia is doing everything to ensure that the price crisis hits the democracies, hits powerfully, so that chaos spreads in Europe and the world. Hence, we must do everything we can to remove any energy dependence on Russia, to eliminate its ability to make money from energy sources and to help people survive this crisis., For our part, we offer our electricity to the EU countries - it is much cheaper than on the European market. Ukraine joined the unified energy system of the continent. We can export many times more electricity than now. Due to this, Ukraine can help at least its neighbors in the European Union overcome the price crisis, and this will definitely reduce the severity of the price crisis in the whole of Europe., We must think together how to get through this winter, given the situation on the gas market. No country in Europe - neither Ukraine, nor the Czech Republic, nor anyone else - should be left alone with the gas problem, as this is Russia's goal. To ensure that we do not help each other., And finally, there must be a value-based response to everything that tyranny has brought to Europe now. To all this terror., Of course, I hope for your support in the creation and functioning of the Special Tribunal to punish those who started the war against Ukraine for the crime of aggression. Of course, we must do everything possible together to punish everyone who killed, tortured, deported Ukrainians. And, by the way, all this will become a historical punishment, in particular, for the system that sent tanks to you in 1968., Another imperative step we must take now. A value-based step. An ethical one. Russian propagandists can still work in European countries. Russian television, which is probably the biggest disinformation source in the world, is still available in European countries. And who are they working against, tell me? What exactly are they trying to destroy or at least discredit in the first place? European democracy!, And Europe needs full protection from Russian propaganda. No Russian propagandist should remain on the territory of the EU. No Russian state television channel should operate on the territory of the EU., And the territory of the EU should be closed to those citizens of Russia who use Europe to rest from the evil they condone at home with their silence. Visa restrictions will encourage Russian citizens to feel that freedom must be fought for., Closing the European visa space for tourists from Russia will definitely protect all countries from the killers who were in Salisbury or Vrbětice., Ladies and Gentlemen!, I have no doubt that we will win the battle for freedom. I have no doubt that we are capable of protecting Europe from any crises that Russia creates. And I have no doubt that we will rebuild everything that was destroyed by the war. But for all this to happen, we must have no doubt that we will preserve our unity - the unity of all Europeans, the unity of the free world. I believe that the Czech Presidency of the Council of the European Union will protect and strengthen our unity. Everyone who stands for freedom should stand together! Together until victory!, Thank you for your attention!, Thank you for your support!, Glory to Ukraine!"
30 August 2022  - 22:03 ,Ukraine will be a full member of the EU and is already closer to Europe than ever - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Ukrainians!, Today, the Verkhovna Rada worked quite effectively and, in particular, endorsed several important laws and ratifications that bring us closer to the European Union. No matter how difficult it is - even in the conditions of such a war - we are moving step by step towards full membership in the EU., I have just signed these documents - on accession to the Convention on the Simplification of Formalities in Trade in Goods and to the Convention on the Common Transit Procedure. They are the actual implementation of the customs visa-free regime. We did it in record time and in a completely coordinated manner - all branches of government., And I want to thank all our diplomats, government officials, deputies who ensured this result. Ukraine will be a full member of the EU - and we are already closer to Europe than at any time in previous decades., Representatives of the IAEA have already arrived in our country and are to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It's an important mission, and we're doing everything we can for it to be safe and work at full capacity., Unfortunately, Russia does not stop provocations precisely in those directions from which the mission is supposed to arrive at the station. But I hope that the IAEA mission will be able to start its work., The situation at the ZNPP and in Enerhodar, in the surrounding areas, remains extremely threatening. The occupiers do not leave the plant, continue shelling and do not take away their weapons and ammunition from the territory of the NPP. They intimidate our plant’s staff. The risk of a radiation disaster due to Russian actions does not decrease for a single hour., Tonight I spoke about it with President of France Emmanuel Macron. We coordinated our positions in protecting Ukraine and Europe from Russian radiation blackmail. In the afternoon, I discussed the situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP and the dispatch of the mission to the plant with IAEA Director General Grossi. I hope that together with international organizations, with all our partners, we will be able to return the plant under the full control of Ukraine and force Russia to withdraw all its military personnel and weapons from the plant. Immediate and complete demilitarization of the ZNPP is needed., Only Ukraine can guarantee that all processes at the Zaporizhzhia plant will take place in accordance with standards and under control. Russia simply does not need it., Today I also held a meeting with American senators - Mr. Portman and Ms. Klobuchar, who arrived in Kyiv. These are people who have done a lot to protect our state and generally freedom in Europe and the world. I thanked them for the bipartisan support., The key topic of the negotiations is, of course, our interaction with the United States of America and the necessary steps for our joint victory in this battle for freedom., In particular, we discussed the strengthening of support for Ukraine - financial and security, strengthening of sanctions against Russia - these sanctions should grow like a snowball in order to demolish the terrorist potential of this state., Over this day, the occupiers brutally shelled Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and our other cities. And almost everywhere - civil infrastructure exactly., Only one Russian shelling of Kharkiv took the lives of 5 people today, another 12 were wounded. There are also victims as a result of other shelling occasions... Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken away by the occupiers!, The Armed Forces of our country, our special services, our intelligence are doing everything possible and impossible for every Russian military to necessarily feel the Ukrainian response to this horrible terror that Russia has brought to our land., Throughout the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine, from Crimea to the Kharkiv region, the Russian army does not have and will not have a single safe base, a single quiet place. Our defenders will destroy all warehouses, headquarters of the occupiers, their equipment, wherever they are located. Near Sevastopol - then near Sevastopol. Near Luhansk - then near Luhansk. This is Ukrainian land, and the occupiers can do only two things - flee or surrender. We leave them no other options., Currently, active hostilities are taking place almost along the entire frontline - in the south, in the Kharkiv region and in Donbas. Today I especially want to thank the warriors of the 56th and 110th brigades, who are showing maximum resilience and heroism in the Avdiivka direction. The warriors of the 53rd and 93rd brigades, who are defending the Bakhmut direction, defending courageously, intelligently, heroically., The Russian military command was instructed to capture the Donetsk region by the end of August. The end of August is already tomorrow. And in Donbas there are the Ukrainian flag and the Ukrainian heroes. Despite everything - despite the round-the-clock Russian fire, despite the occupiers' efforts to send various mercenaries and convicts there..., I thank each and every one who stands firm, who defends positions and who accurately ""subtracts"" the invaders, their equipment, logistics and ammunition., Also, today I want to once again draw the attention of all our people in Crimea - please stay away from Russian military facilities, do not stay near Russian bases and military airfields, inform the special services of Ukraine of all the information you know about the occupiers, so that the liberation of Crimea can happen faster., Eternal glory to all our heroes!, Eternal glory to all those who help in the fight for life, for independence!, Glory to Ukraine!"
29 August 2022  - 22:47 ,"The occupiers should know: we will oust them to our border, the line of which has not changed - address by the President of Ukraine",", Ukrainians!, Today we honored the memory of our warriors who gave their lives for our state, for our independence., This day of remembrance is set for the end of summer, August 29, to remind everyone about the tragic events of 2014, about Ilovaisk, about the fact that this war, which began with Russia's occupation of our Crimea, with an attempt to seize Donbas, must end precisely there - in the liberated Crimea, in the liberated cities of Donbas, with our troops reaching the state border of Ukraine., We have always kept this goal in mind. We do not forget about it., The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence, our defense forces are doing their job. I am sure that you all understand what is happening, what we are fighting for and what we are striving for. And our warriors do not need any announcements or information waves in the back., Ukraine is returning its own. And it will return the Kharkiv region, Luhansk region, Donetsk region, Zaporizhzhia region, Kherson region, Crimea, definitely our entire water area of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov - from Zmiinyi Island to the Kerch Strait. This will happen. This is ours. And just as our society understands it, I want the occupiers to understand it, too. There will be no place for them on Ukrainian land., Anyone want to know what our plans are? You won't hear specifics from any truly responsible person. Because this is war. And this is what it is during the war., But the occupiers should know: we will oust them to the border. To our border, the line of which has not changed. The invaders know it well., If they want to survive, it is time for the Russian military to flee. Go home. If you are afraid to return to your home in Russia - well, let such occupiers surrender, and we will guarantee them compliance with all norms of the Geneva Conventions., If they do not listen to me, they will deal with our defenders, who will not stop until they liberate everything that belongs to Ukraine., And it is not something special. It's not something that supposedly started. We've been talking about it for 187 days., Today, I held meetings with the military, with representatives of the military-industrial sector, and with government officials. Important meetings, important topics, it is wrong to reveal them. But everyone can see the result over time. When our defenders destroy the logistics, bases, and headquarters of the enemy. We will continue this.,  , I’ve made three appeals to foreign partners today., The first is Norway. I took part in the work of the energy forum, and I would like to thank the Prime Minister of Norway, Mr. Støre, for the new support package for Ukraine - about 200 million dollars as part of the energy preparation for winter., The second is France. A powerful association of entrepreneurs - hundreds of thousands of businessmen, millions of owners, managers and employees. I am grateful to them for their support and understanding of what we are fighting for in Ukraine, understanding that this struggle is shared by all Europeans., The third appeal is to the participants of the security forum in Slovenia, in particular, to our friends - the leaders of the countries of Central Europe and the Balkans., In the evening, I signed a decree awarding our warriors. 141 combatants were awarded state awards, ten of them posthumously., It is very important - today I had the honor to present the Gold Star Orders to the relatives, families of Heroes perished while performing combat missions., Eternal memory to all our heroes! Eternal glory to all those who fight for freedom for our entire land!, Glory to Ukraine!"
29 August 2022  - 21:12 ,European countries and the entire free world should encourage Russian citizens to fight for a change in Russian policy – address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the Bled Strategic Forum (Slovenia),", Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen!, Dear participants of the Forum!, I am grateful for this opportunity to address you and everyone present, as well as all Europeans!, Today is an important day for us - the Day of Remembrance of the Defenders of Ukraine who died in the struggle for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state. At this time, in August 2014, Ukrainian warriors were vilely killed near the city of Ilovaisk in Donbas. They were brutally shot by Russian troops. Ukraine lost hundreds of its sons then - in a few days. Hundreds of those thousands perished in the war since 2014., In the war that reached the scale of a total war on February 24 of this year. Russia's full-scale war against the life and freedom of our people, against ordinary peaceful cities that are being destroyed by Russian artillery, and against the culture of our people, which Russia wants to completely erase - Russian propagandists and officials do not even conceal this goal, they say absolutely openly that they want to destroy everything Ukrainian. So that it does not exist., They do not perceive the very fact of the independent existence of our people. Like any of your people. As we repel Russian aggression on our soil, we protect every European people from exactly the same expansion - the expansion of those who have nothing human left in them., Is there any human in someone who rapes children in front of their parents? In the one who forces the inhabitants of the entire village - everyone from small children to the elderly - to sit in the basement of the school for a month? Is there any human in someone who strikes heavy anti-ship missiles, which were built to destroy aircraft carriers, at an ordinary shopping mall full of people. In the one who supplies shells to the artillery, which day after day burns city blocks, ordinary residential buildings. In the one who interrogates and tortures people in the so-called filtration camps created by Russian forces throughout the occupied territory. Imagine: XXI century, filtration camps. Is there any human in someone who separates Ukrainian children from their parents and gives them for criminal adoption in Russia knowing that these children have relatives in Ukraine. Relatives who are alive and who are looking for them., When we talk about Russian aggression against Ukraine and all of Russia's pressure on Europe accompanying this aggression - and this is very cynical pressure, this is the deliberate destruction of normal economic and social life, this is the energy and price crises in Europe, which are artificially exacerbated by Russia - when we talk about all this, we mean not only those who are at the highest levels of the Russian power hierarchy. We are talking about thousands and thousands of different people with the passport of a Russian citizen., About those who shoot at our soldiers on the battlefield and shoot civilians in the back of the head. We are talking about those who press the buttons to strike Russian missiles at Ukrainian cities. About those who design and manufacture these missiles and other weapons used for terror. Those who work in companies that provide for the Russian army and special services. Those who conscript, transport and in every way support Russian murderers. We are talking about those who provide for corrupt Russian officials and generals, who manage numerous businesses that are related to corrupt Russian officials. Those who sow hatred for any manifestation of freedom, promote war, support repression. Those who remain silent when they see all this and do nothing - do not protest, do not fight - even when they are completely safe in European countries., Russia's war against Ukraine has been ongoing since 2014. For more than six months, the Russian state has been spending all its available resources to destroy our state and split Europe. Most European countries have already seen and experienced one or another of Russia's attempts to put pressure, inflict damage and bring suffering to people., And according to the logic of any normal person, it is the citizens of Russia who have something human left in them who should be the first to oppose the war. If they have conscience, if they have shame. But we do not see constant and noticeable anti-war protests with the participation of citizens of this state - even where there is no risk for them of any repression for protests, I repeat this once again. Why so? I'll leave you with that question. It is complicated - so why is it so?, Europe is not a quiet haven where you can just sit out the time when someone else is fighting against Russian terror. But, unfortunately, many citizens of Russia perceive Europe this way. That is why they need European visas. And, unfortunately, none of your states is immune from the fact that war criminals, on whose hands there is the blood of Ukrainians, will come to you simply as tourists, and one day they will receive an order - and they will become not tourists at all., It shouldn't be like that. And all of us in Europe have to protect ourselves from this. Both those who are part of the European Union and all other European countries. Because Russian terror is an equal threat to all of us, to all who live here, to all European nations., The one who does not fight against terror supports it, and therefore shares the responsibility for all its consequences. This should be the rule that overrides all other rules. A state that threatens everyone around it - from the Baltic states to Kazakhstan - should be under a full embargo from everyone in the world who values freedom and respects themselves. We need an embargo on all relations with Russia, with a terrorist state, as long as Russia continues the war, occupies foreign territory, destroys the lives of other nations., Ladies and Gentlemen!, Ukraine is paying the most terrible price for freedom and for the ideals we share with you. Thousands of people died. Dozens of cities and villages were destroyed, now they are black ruins that look through burned windows at Russia and whether the world is able to stop it and bring it to account for everything done against peaceful people., Millions of Ukrainians were forced to leave their native places fleeing hostilities. And we can’t stand seeing how someone under the flag of the occupiers humiliates our people in some European cities sometimes. We can't stand seeing how thousands of those responsible for this war smile cynically, hoping that Russia will succeed in breaking Europe and returning to, as they call it, business as usual. And hundreds of millions of people throughout the free world can’t stand seeing it either., Hence, we need to act now so that our shared freedom is protected for generations to come. The stability and free development of Eastern Europe, the Balkans and all other parts of our continent of values, our continent of freedom must be protected and guaranteed. And that means very specific things., Sufficient defense support for Ukraine, support with weapons, shells, so that this war does not drag on, so that victory is achieved as soon as possible., Sufficient sanction pressure on Russia - to destroy the illusion of the Russian leadership that they will be able withstand the struggle against the free world., Sufficient protection of Europe itself - our people, our markets from Russia's hybrid aggression, which is betting on the spread of crises and poverty as much as it is betting on weapons., This also means our close coordination in strengthening our association, in the integration processes in Europe, in security cooperation between our states. A stronger Ukraine means a stronger Europe. A stronger Balkans means a stronger Europe. We must continue to help each other on the European path, as we are doing now., And it is imperative that the entire European Union, all European countries and the entire free world encourage Russian citizens to fight for a change in Russian state policy, encourage them not to remain silent and not to be complicit in terror., You know what to do. I am grateful to everyone who is already helping Ukraine. By helping us, you gave not excess, but what really matters to you. We appreciate it. We know that when we are fighting, when all of us are fighting together against this aggression, we are not just fighting for ourselves, but for Europe to win. The real struggle of each country for independence is a difficult path, it is what generations gain. And now we have the opportunity to achieve victory for ourselves, for our children, for our grandchildren, for all generations of our nations who fought for freedom earlier., I am sure we will win. We will win together. And this will be done in the name of Europe, in the name of all those who gave their lives for freedom., I thank you for your support!, I thank you for your attention!, Glory to Ukraine!"
29 August 2022  - 17:39 ,It is important to do everything so that Russia can never again blackmail either Ukraine or France - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the annual meeting of French entrepreneurs under the auspices of the MEDEF business association,", Dear Mr. President of the MEDEF!, Dear ministers, dear MEDEF members!, Ladies and Gentlemen!, I am grateful to you for the invitation, for this opportunity to address you, to address in your person the entire people of France - each and every one who believes that no one has the right to destroy someone's life., I know that MEDEF unites and protects the interests of hundreds of thousands of businesses in France. You represent people who have created and who are developing businesses in different areas, completely different industries., You represent people who work hard to be able to provide for their children and exercise their rights. The right to live, the right to be free, the right to happiness, the right to well-being, the right to housing, the right to education, the right to work, the right to a decent wage and other absolutely common modern human rights., And in fact, your association represents the very people that I, as the President of Ukraine, represent., Our people wanted nothing more than to live in their own country, enjoy their freedoms, work for their own good and the future of their children. Ukraine did not go to someone else’s home with weapons. Ukrainians were not going to rob any other people or any state. We cared about our social development, our democracy and dreamed that one day we would be in the European Union together with you and other nations of Europe., And that is why this Russian war against Ukraine began. The leadership of Russia saw that Ukraine can become and is becoming a positive example for our region. An example that democracy can give more to society than dictatorship can. This seems to be an obvious opinion in Western Europe, but in the east of our continent, and especially in the territory of the former USSR, this is not an obvious fact, it needs to be proved. And Ukraine did everything to prove it., Our state set an example of how to take care of society without crazy dollars and euros earned from the sale of oil and gas. How to create opportunities for social development. How to strengthen the regions of the state, not drain money from them. How to build modern infrastructure. How to create such opportunities for citizens that others in our region simply do not have thanks to the openness of society and the modernity of state institutions., In particular, we conducted and continue to digitize public services. Our goal is to ensure that relations between a citizen and the state, between any company and the state take place without the mediation of a government official. This is a necessary condition for overcoming any risks of corruption and for the real freedom of people and business - something that dozens of other governments cannot dare to do. And this is something that every Ukrainian has in his smartphone today. This is ""Diia"" state service, which gives people dozens of different opportunities: from digital documents and vaccination certificates to the ability to register a business or pay fines., We combine our economy and energy sphere with the European market and other advanced world markets. We have deposits of natural resources that are critically important for the world economy, including lithium, titanium, uranium, etc., Ukraine has already become a guarantor of global food security. The value of our agrarian exports was fully demonstrated when Russia blocked Ukrainian ports, and as a result, the global food crisis aggravated., Russia's war against Ukraine is not just a colonial war in the worst sense of the word, it is not just an attempt to appropriate our land, resources or the potential of our people. Through the destruction of Ukraine, Russia is trying to destroy the hope of all nations near its borders and all peoples in the territory of Russia itself that freedom will really work. That democracy will help with development. That human rights and human dignity can give society more than the mercy of some dictator., That is why the Russian war against Ukraine is so brutal. That is why it became total from the first minute on February 24., That is why Russian cruise missiles and artillery destroy everything from day one. Everything that was built and developed by generations of Ukrainians. Schools and hospitals, universities, railway stations, airports, residential buildings of ordinary people, factories, bakeries, port facilities and even ordinary tire repair stations, ordinary shopping malls, machine-building plants, water plants, power plants - absolutely everything., Dropping a bomb on a maternity hospital, a theater or a warehouse with food is all the same to the Russian occupiers. All these are the same targets for them. Burning cities and making millions of people forcibly displaced are just tools for them. Because Russia's goal is to destroy Ukraine as a democracy, a social state, an economic power, a society of educated people who know how to work for their own interests. Like all people., But that is why I believe in our victory. When someone is at war with an entire nation, he has no chance. For us, this is a people's war. And nations are invincible! And when the nation has such friends like the Ukrainians have, victory becomes inevitable., I am sincerely grateful to you, the people of France, and I am personally grateful to President Emmanuel Macron for support in this fight for freedom. I saw how Emmanuel was looking for a diplomatic way, looking for steps to stop the war., I have devoted several years as president to finding a solution, a peaceful, diplomatic model of coexistence without war. But, unfortunately, the leadership of Russia does not want to live without war. The leadership of Russia considers the free and democratic life of Ukraine as an existential challenge for itself. That is why they want war and destruction. They think that this way they can secure their dictatorship for many years., And that is why it is important to achieve victory. It is important to do everything so that the victory takes place as soon as possible. It is important to do everything so that Russia can never again blackmail either Ukraine or France. You don't feel it as much as we do yet. And hopefully the war will not come to your land, but this is it. All this is their plan. Neither any European state, nor Europe in general can be blackmailed with a war, an energy crisis or a food crisis., It is important to rebuild Ukraine after the war. Peace for Ukraine, guarantees of security, restoration of everything destroyed by the Russian occupiers will be clear proof that the European idea is stronger than any dictatorships, and the values of freedom, equality and mutual aid overcome any terror., And that is why I am addressing you today. Ukraine can give you thousands of contracts, thousands of jobs. We need your experience and your participation in post-war reconstruction. We have already started - on the free territory of our country., We invite construction companies to take part in infrastructure reconstruction, localization of production of construction materials., We invite companies that can help in the modernization of communal infrastructure - water supply, water purification, waste sorting and processing., We invite energy companies to produce and store gas, build green energy, produce hydrogen and develop our nuclear energy industry., We invite automotive companies to localize the production of electric cars and components., We invite food companies to engage in agro-processing and food production for the 40-million market of Ukraine and the entire European market with which we are fully integrated., And we will come to the entire territory of our country currently occupied by Russia in order to return this territory to Europe., Perhaps some of you already know that at the level of our Governments - Ukraine and France - we are preparing to hold such an initiative in Paris in the autumn - a forum on the recovery of Ukraine. I invite your companies to participate in this initiative., I know that there are companies that have already responded and are participating in the reconstruction of our state. In particular, I am grateful to Matière company for its support in the restoration of our bridge infrastructure., I would also like to thank the Île-de-France region for starting a partnership with the Chernihiv and Kyiv regions, and the Grand-Est region for a partnership with the Kharkiv region. And I am also grateful to all other small and large cities of France, which came to the aid of Ukraine in this important, cruel time., I remember how last year, even before the start of the full-scale war, we met in Kyiv with the MEDEF delegation. Good ideas and ambitious projects were discussed. I want to confirm - we will be able to implement them, we will be able to do a lot together., Because we equally value freedom, equally respect human rights, equally care about social development., We are all people, we are all Europeans, and that says it all!, Thank you for your attention!, Thanks, France, for your support!, Glory to Ukraine!"
29 August 2022  - 15:49 ,"Energy independence from Russia is of fundamental importance for all Europeans, and only together can we protect Europe – speech by the President of Ukraine at the Offshore Northern Seas Conference 2022",", Your Royal Highness, Mr. Prime Minister!, Dear businessmen present!, Dear Mr. Elon Musk!, Dear friends!, Ladies and Gentlemen!, I am grateful to each and every one of you who is present for the opportunity to talk and for the opportunity to participate in this important discussion., I'm sure you are well informed about the situation in Europe, about the risks - I heard you talked about them now - that we all face now in addition to the brutal terrorist war that Russia is waging against our citizens, our state, against our independence. And it is important to know that this is the independence of all other European states. This is a war for independence as such., We all see how destabilized the gas market is. We all see how European countries are revising their plans for coal, coal-fired power plants. We can all see that the threat of energy poverty is becoming real for tens of millions of people in Europe, who until recently could afford normal energy consumption. We all see that the price of energy is so high that thousands of businesses have gone into crisis. And this leads to a reduction in jobs and a drop in workers' incomes. And in winter, energy prices can rise even more..., We all see that for the first time since 1986, when the Chornobyl tragedy occurred, we have to consider as seriously as possible the scenarios for countering the radiation disaster that Russia is bringing closer with its terror at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. These are all well-known facts. But what do they testify to?, People often draw completely different conclusions from the same facts - some are right, and some are wrong. In the discussions, the opinion of the majority is determined afterwards - either right or wrong. Sometimes mistakes leave no trace. And sometimes the price of mistakes becomes very high, when erroneous conclusions lead to erroneous political decisions., This is what the authors of this large-scale – and completely artificial – crisis that Europe is going through are counting on. They want the Europeans to be scared. To draw wrong conclusions and give up European values in favor of illusory price reductions. Russia is using economic terror, price crisis pressure and poverty to weaken Europe just when its full force is needed to defend against terror in the war that Russia has been waging for more than six months. Full-scale war! And in general, its invasion of Ukraine has already been lasting for 8 years., This is what the Russian state, its officials and companies, such as Gazprom, are working for. For creating crises and for crises to turn into disasters. Right now, Russia is burning at least 10 million euros worth of gas near the Finnish border every day. Gas is being burned that should have been supplied to German and other European consumers. Russia cannot stop its production, does not want to supply it to the Europeans, as it is interested in the crisis, and has no other buyers. So it just burns this gas. Just like they burn our people., 10 million euros on fire every day at the border of Russia is hundreds of millions of euros in additional expenses of the European middle class, ordinary workers, pensioners on energy every day as well. Because of the inflated prices on the market, because of the shortage, because of Russia trying to prevent the replenishment of European gas storages before winter., A normal market player would have already supplied the free volume of gas to the market. The terrorist state does everything to ensure that there is as little gas as possible on the market at the highest possible price, which leads to an increase in other prices. And this is all part of the Russian hybrid aggression against all people, against all of us, against all of you, against all of united Europe., And take a look at the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Why is Russia doing this? What is the purpose of the radiation blackmail for Russia? The goal is the same, completely cynical, completely deliberate - to intimidate Ukrainians, to intimidate all Europeans. To blackmail and coerce. This pressure is for Russian state propagandists and officials to say that it is allegedly not Russia to blame, that someone else created another crisis and that this someone should be influenced, and that it is allegedly necessary to negotiate with the Kremlin precisely for this reason., Just think about it: Russia is the only terrorist in the world who managed to turn a nuclear power plant into a battlefield and who consistently does everything to make Europe watch where the wind may blow the radiation if, God forbid, a disaster occurs., Most of the older generation of Norway, I think, well remember that the consequences of the accident at the Chornobyl plant were felt even in central Norway - in the area of Trondheim and in the north of your country. And for all of us, this is a terrible risk. This is a memory of the unacceptable, and for Russia it is just an additional opportunity., The fact is that the Russian leadership has a specific bandit’s logic - they create problems, hoping that the victims of these problems will come and try to agree on their solution, and the bandit will get something for it., Russia wants Europe to turn a blind eye to the war, and for this purpose it is provoking internal chaos in Europe. Russia wants to take away freedom from us by force of arms, and from you - by these crises that it creates and exacerbates. Russia wants to force you to abandon European values. Here is a correct conclusion from the available facts. And based on this conclusion, a correct policy is needed. The policy of even greater unity, as the Prime Minister has said now, unity in Europe for our common defense. The policy of even greater energy independence of Europe from Russia. The policy of even greater sanctions against Russia., It is not normal when there are still no blocking sanctions against Rosatom for radiation blackmail at the Zaporizhzhia NPP, for which specific Rosatom employees at the plant are also responsible. And it is not normal when any Russian citizen can get a visa to European countries to go on vacation or go shopping - we know this very well - even if he is a war criminal or helps the Russian state work against Europe. It is not normal when some European companies are still hesitant whether to leave the Russian market or not. And it is not normal when someone still hopes for cooperation with Russia in the energy sector. There can be no concessions to bandits! Only new sanction strikes against them., I want to give an example of Norway - an example of true principles in the defense of Europe. Despite the fact that Norway is not a member of the European Union, you joined the European sanctions against Russia. Defense and other assistance to our country from Norway is vital - we will always be grateful for it. We are glad to hear that your energy companies are increasing the volume of gas supplies to European countries, while Russia is willing to simply burn gas in order not to supply it. And we note Norway's contribution to the development of renewable energy sources, to carbon capture and storage, to the development of batteries and hydrogen energy. Europe will become truly strong and secure from crises when all European countries become as principled as Norway., For its part, Ukraine can already do - and is doing - concrete things to protect our common values and normal life on the continent., We are fighting for freedom and for everything that Europe is based on, defending all Europeans in this war. And this is not pathos - this is the truth! We have united Europeans and helped overcome the various contradictions that have been dividing the continent for decades. We have shown what power Europe has when united and what enemies it can overcome., In addition, Ukraine can become - I believe it will become - one of the guarantors of the energy security of the European continent. Together with Ukraine, you will be able to prevent such price crises ever again., We have a unique system of gas storage facilities near the border of the European Union, with a volume of more than 30 billion cubic meters. We are asked about help. That's how practical it is - use our gas storages already this season. Today, for example, we have a free volume of 15 billion cubic meters. Ukraine needs 3 billion of additional reserves, which we ask you to keep in Ukraine, and another 12 billion cubic meters may be the gas needed in winter for the security of all of Europe. You can help us - and this will be your help both to us and to yourself., Ukraine also has significant deposits of natural gas. The leadership of Russia dreamed of stealing this part of our national wealth from us as well. But we will not allow it. We invite all investors, contractors and service companies to join gas production in Ukraine. If you want to help us pragmatically, please use this tool. Obtain licenses, enter into agreements on the distribution of products, carry out exploration and drilling. We would appreciate it. Our gas fields can play the same stabilizing role for Europe as the fields of Norway in particular., We are preparing to increase the export of our electricity to the countries of the European Union - despite the war, during the war we ensure this export, and our electricity is much cheaper than what is currently available on the market. We can really help overcome the cost of living crisis in our neighboring EU countries., And we invite you to invest in the production of green energy and green hydrogen in Ukraine. Our state is one of the best locations for providing all of Europe with green energy and green hydrogen. We have everything for this – enough land, good wind, good sun, as well as ready-made energy logistics – powerful power transmission lines, gas pipelines that can be used for hydrogen – of course, after appropriate modernization., We are not saying for the first time that Europe's independence from Russia, particularly in energy, is of fundamental importance to all Europeans. And we are not saying for the first time that Europe can do much more together with Ukraine than with Russia., We don't want to look into the past, we don't want to repeat who didn't hear us. Ukraine wants us all not to lose the opportunities we have at this historical moment. Only together can we protect Europe. Only by preserving our maximum principles. And only by achieving victory in this war together., I thank you for your attention! Thank you!, Glory to Ukraine!"
28 August 2022  - 21:47 ,We have not forgotten and will not forget any of our cities and any of our people – address of the President of Ukraine,", Dear Ukrainians!, Every year, on the last weekend of summer, two holidays were celebrated in our country – they are closely related – Donetsk City Day and Miner's Day., In 2014, everything changed for Donetsk because of the occupiers. And this year, all of Ukraine will not have holidays. But we have not forgotten and will not forget any of our cities and any of our people., Donetsk has always been one of the richest and strongest cities in Ukraine. Mining has always been one of the most respected professions. Now Donbas is almost destroyed by Russian strikes, devastated. The proud and glorious Ukrainian Donetsk was humiliated by the Russian occupation and robbed. Russia brought the most terrible thing there – absolute disregard for the value of any life, absolute disrespect for anyone. The invaders brought degradation and death. And they believe that they are there forever. But it's a temporary thing for them., And Ukraine will return. For sure. Life will return. The dignity of the people of Donbas will return. The ability to live will return. The opportunity to live safely and happily. This is exactly what our Ukrainian flag will symbolize when we set it up in Donetsk, Horlivka, Mariupol, in all cities of Donbas, Azov area, in all areas under Russian occupation – in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson regions. And definitely – in Crimea., Ukraine remembers everything., I held a meeting today with representatives of the defense and security sector. It was attended by the heads of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, intelligence, the Security Service of Ukraine, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and other structures and areas of defense of our state., All the issues we considered are important, but secret, I cannot go into detail. But the occupiers will feel its consequences – in the further actions of our defenders., No terrorist will go unanswered for attacks on our cities. Zaporizhzhia, Orikhiv, Kharkiv, Donbas – they will receive an answer for all of them., We are preparing for a new week – it will be very active. Important visits of partners to Ukraine are planned. I will resume the practice of appeals to the states and nations that support us., And most importantly, we are working to ensure that there are new restrictions for Russia because of the war and that there are new support packages for our defenders, for our state. Defense support – weapons and ammunition, financial support, political support, media support, support for our reconstruction – every day every public official must demonstrate results in his area of responsibility. Only work for results gives the right to hold public positions. This should be remembered by everyone who was given power., Thank you to everyone who honestly works for the state! Thanks to all our defenders!, Glory to our soldiers!, Glory to our people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
27 August 2022  - 22:05 ,Today I thank all our pilots who are doing a lot to bring the victory of Ukraine closer – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Dear Ukrainians! I wish you health!, Today is Aviation Day. It is traditionally celebrated in our country on the last Saturday of August. It is a professional holiday of people without whom the present cannot be imagined. And without which we cannot imagine the independence of our state., Russia hoped to destroy our aircraft in the first hours of the full-scale invasion. And, of course, this enemy had a completely insane goal, like many other such goals. The Air Force of Ukraine was preserved, and since the first day of the invasion, it has been honorably performing combat missions., In six months, 18 pilots were honored with the title of Hero of Ukraine. Dozens more have been given state awards. Their skills and combat results have become a true legend, and I have repeatedly heard the highest praise of our aviation from representatives of the armies and states of our partners., Ukrainian aviation is strong. It will be among the most modern, that's for sure. This cannot be changed. But even in the extremely difficult conditions that exist now, Ukrainian pilots show the greatest skills., Today I thank all our pilots, everyone who services flights, prepares equipment for flights, and everyone who helps Ukrainian military aviation to be able to perform combat missions. And separately, I want to thank the parents of our soldiers, mothers and fathers of Ukrainian pilots, for such brave and intelligent sons who did and are doing a lot to bring our victory – the victory of Ukraine – closer., Once again – Happy Aviation Day of Ukraine!, This week, for the Independence Day of our country, I signed a number of decrees on awarding representatives of various professions, various groups of our society. In general, those who really helped the defense of Ukraine, the defense of independence, our people, and who are really known at the front., I asked the military and law enforcement officers, all authorities – central and regional, ministries and regional administrations, as well as representatives of the media – to provide me with nominations of those who deserve awards. Those in the trenches, those who support our boys and girls. Name the people they know in the army, whom they are truly grateful to on the front lines. Who support the fighting spirit of Ukrainians, our faith in ourselves, who spread the truth about the war. Who are mobilizing assistance for Ukraine abroad. Who support the displaced people... Volunteers and officials, journalists and workers of utility service enterprises, communications operators, transport workers and athletes, artists, musicians, public figures, workers of the energy industry, post office... Many different people whose candidacies were proposed. There are also those who are awarded, unfortunately, posthumously., Of course, I also signed decrees on awarding our soldiers – in the Armed Forces, in intelligence, in the Security Service of Ukraine. In total, since February 24, 27,760 of our defenders have been given state awards of Ukraine., Tomorrow, on Sunday, these decrees will be made public. And there will be another decree – a very important, special decree – on awarding state awards to friends of Ukraine abroad, our partners, our helpers in the struggle for freedom and life. Those whose contribution is really significant. Those to whom Ukraine will always be grateful., Because the struggle for independence is the struggle of the entire nation, and only in this way it can be successful. It is nationwide here in Ukraine. And that is why Ukraine will win. The people always win. And the successful struggle for freedom in the world also cannot be the struggle of only individual people or individual states. It is a joint work, a common result, which is achieved thanks to the strength and solidarity of all who value freedom and who do not tolerate tyranny. Freedom always wins. We will definitely win!, Eternal glory to all our heroes!, Eternal gratitude to everyone who helps fight for freedom, for our state!, Glory to Ukraine!"
26 August 2022  - 22:36 ,"Armed Forces of Ukraine, our people prove to occupiers every day that they have no chance to stay safe on Ukrainian land – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Good evening, Ukrainians!, Europeans!, Our nuclear scientists, all specialists in the energy industry, manage to protect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the worst-case scenario, which is constantly being provoked by Russian forces. Currently, the plant has been connected to the grid. My congratulations. It produces power for Ukraine., I want to emphasize that the situation remains very risky and dangerous. Any repeat of yesterday's events, that is, any disconnection of the plant from the grid, any actions by Russia that could trigger the shutdown of the reactors, will again put the plant one step away from disaster., That is why it is so important that the IAEA mission arrives at the plant as soon as possible and helps keep the NPP under continuous control of Ukraine. That is why it is so important that Russian troops withdraw from the plant and neighboring areas and that the threat of shelling of the plant itself or power lines connected to it disappears., Ukrainian diplomats and our partners continue to fight for the safety of the Zaporizhzhia NPP every day. And today I want to thank all those who are mobilizing the world's response to Russian radiation blackmail. To all our nuclear scientists – you are great, you are cool! To all our engineers – you are strong – whose professionalism is now literally saving both Ukraine and Europe when they overcome the consequences of Russian terror at the plant!, Today, we can draw the first conclusions about the rescue of many countries and peoples from the food crisis, which Russia wanted so badly to exacerbate into real famine. The grain export initiative has been operating for almost a month, and during this time, the first million tonnes of foodstuffs were exported from our three seaports in Chornomorsk, Odesa and Yuzhne since February 24. This is a victory., This means in practice that Ukrainian grain and the very fact that the Ukrainian supply route to the world food market has worked, make it possible to prevent chaos on the market, reduce the severity of the food crisis and prevent a catastrophic shortage. Ukraine was, is and will be among the guarantors of global food security., By the way, 44 vessels with Ukrainian foodstuffs have already been sent to 15 countries of the world, we have 70 more applications for the arrival of vessels at ports for loading. The goal is to reach the volume of 3 million tonnes of export by sea every month. And this is extremely important for Africa, Asia and Europe., It is also important that our society realizes that this export not only supports the international subject status of Ukraine, but also provides jobs for our citizens – it is hundreds of thousands of jobs, it provides income for Ukrainian companies, for our budget and, what is very important, it provides funds for planting next year., I still remember the joy of port workers in Odesa, when they not only learned, but actually saw that the port had resumed operations. This is a really important result for Ukraine, for the Black Sea region and for the whole world., And I am grateful to everyone who joined this work, this initiative. I emphasize that it is the full responsibility of the partners to prevent any Russian provocations and disruption of exports., We continue mobilizing media support for Ukraine. Now it is time that we need to look for even more non-standard channels for spreading the truth about Russia's war against you and us, about our independence, about the needs of our state. We constantly find new information friends – real friends – partners in the defense of freedom and in countering Russian disinformation., Yes, today I spoke with Jimmy Fallon – a very famous American talk show host, actor – about options for how to draw attention to Ukraine, how to convey the truth to the United States, to the people. How can we still help Ukraine? It was his main question. The question is how to win in this information war against the lies of the Russian Federation., The situation on the front line remains unchanged these days. Our soldiers are doing everything possible to reduce the firepower and logistical potential of the occupiers. I think you all see the relevant news – about the destruction of the bases of the occupiers, their warehouses, those river crossings that they use., And the more successful we will be in this – our intelligence, our army, the Security Service of Ukraine – the sooner we will be able to change the situation at the front in our favor. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, all our people, prove to the Russian occupiers every day that they do not have and will not have a chance to stay safe on Ukrainian land. The day will come when the occupiers will admit it. Or there simply won't be any left., Eternal glory to all of you, defenders of our state!, Eternal glory to our strong, indomitable, wise, beautiful people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
25 August 2022  - 22:18 ,Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans one step away from a radiation disaster - address by the President of Ukraine,", Ukrainians!, All Europeans!, Today, for the first time in history, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant stopped. The emergency protection of the power units worked - after the last working line of the plant's power return to the Ukrainian power system was damaged by Russian shelling., Diesel generators were immediately activated to provide energy to the plant itself, to support it after the shutdown. The world must understand what a threat this is: if the diesel generators hadn’t turned on, if the automation and our staff of the plant had not reacted after the blackout, then we would already be forced to overcome the consequences of the radiation accident. Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster., The south of Ukraine - the occupied areas - is already in a state of humanitarian disaster. In addition to all the evil that the occupiers brought there, electricity, water and sewage were cut off. Russia has brought degradation to our land, which has never been seen here. All this was simply impossible before the occupation. But this is the essence and pride of the modern Russian state: it is capable of only one thing - making the worst possible., I want to assure all Ukrainians: we are doing everything to prevent an emergency scenario. But it depends not only on our state. The key thing is that such international pressure is needed that will force the occupiers to immediately withdraw from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP. The IAEA and other international organizations must act much faster than they’re acting now. Because every minute the Russian troops stay at the nuclear power plant is a risk of a global radiation disaster., Of course, we are doing everything so that the world knows every detail of the situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. And, in particular, today I talked about it in detail with President of the United States of America Biden. I am grateful to him for understanding and fully supporting the need to return the plant under the Ukrainian control and provide for the IAEA access immediately. This can be done in a matter of days, before the occupiers bring the situation to an irreversible point. And it's easier to do it now than later, if the wind starts blowing radiation pollution across Europe., In general, our conversation with President Biden today was very constructive, positive, quite long and productive. We managed to discuss all issues that are of vital importance for the protection of Ukraine and freedom. I thanked Mr. President and all the people of the United States for the defense assistance and for the tangible leadership in the macro-financial support of our state., Just yesterday, President Biden approved a $6 billion package: three for defense assistance, three for financial assistance through the World Bank system., I expressed particular gratitude for the inclusion of air defense in this package. We can really achieve a situation when the Russian missile terror will be overcome after Ukraine receives NASAMS air defense systems., Today, I also had a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy who was on a visit to Ukraine. I thanked the Italian people, the President of Italy and personally Prime Minister of Italy Draghi for his principles in the defense of a united Europe. Mr. Draghi became one of those European leaders whose determination and personal morality made it possible at a critical moment to strengthen Europe and protect normal life on our continent., We discussed today the expansion of cooperation between our states and Italy's experience in strengthening security, in particular energy security., By the way, due to Russian gas blackmail, gas prices in Europe today have already exceeded the level of $3,300 per thousand cubic meters. And this Russian anti-European policy is truly destructive, but in a strategic perspective – for Russia itself. There will no longer be such a player on the European energy market as Russia., Of course, now the situation is very dangerous, very acute. But most European countries have approached energy issues very responsibly and are doing everything to adapt, to protect themselves. If someone in Russia thinks that they will bring Europe as a whole or Ukraine or other individual countries to their knees this winter, then this is a miscalculation. I believe that Europe is strong enough to correct the mistakes of the past, to become independent from the Russian energy system, from Russian energy carriers and not to give in to the blackmail of energy terrorists from Gazprom., Ukraine is closely coordinating actions with its partners in these issues as well - in energy issues. The Government of Ukraine, our state-owned companies are doing everything to ensure that we are ready to go through this winter season, which will indeed be the most difficult in our history., And we are now in such circumstances, when it is already clear that the enemy will not achieve its goals, but it still takes time, efforts are still needed for the Russian calculation to fail, so that they lose in this direction as well. We have to endure this time and make all the necessary efforts together with our partners. And so it will be., We will put pressure on terrorists on all fronts - on the frontline, on the political front, in economic matters, in the information sphere., For every shelling, there will be a response to the occupiers. It will be for Orikhiv. It will be for Chaplyne. It will be for Shepetivka, for Myrhorod, for Kharkiv, for Mariupol and the cities of Donbas, for all others who are targeted by the Russian military., Russia has prepared many problems, crises and catastrophes for our country, for Europe and for the world. But the greatest disaster will still be experienced by it itself, the terrorist state itself. This ""Titanic"" came to its iceberg on February 24, and no matter how hard they try to stay afloat, they won’t., Eternal glory to all who fight for freedom!, Eternal glory to all our warriors!, Glory to Ukraine!"
24 August 2022  - 23:29 ,There are no such missiles that can break the will of the people who believe in themselves - address by the President of Ukraine,", Fellow Ukrainians!, It's almost night, our main day, Independence Day of Ukraine, is coming to an end. But our independence does not end and will never end. And there will be our 32nd Independence Day, and 33rd, and all the following ones, as long as time on earth lasts. Ukraine will live forever. And it will only get stronger every day. And absolutely everyone in the world understands this - from the UN Security Council to all capitals without exception., Therefore, let's not retreat from our path, let's fight, express gratitude to everyone who supports us, take care of our state, preserve our unity - the same unity as today, as every day over these six months. And no enemy will be able to defeat us. There are no such bombs that can erase freedom, and there will never be such missiles that can break the will of the people who believe in themselves., Chaplyne is our pain today. As of this moment, there are 22 dead, five of them burned in the car, an 11-year-old teenager died, a Russian missile destroyed his house., Search and rescue operations at the railway station will continue. We will definitely make the occupiers bear responsibility for everything they have done. And we will certainly drive the invaders out of our land. Not a single stain of this evil will remain in our free Ukraine. We will make our way to victory! It will happen!, Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by these invaders, these enemies., Eternal glory to all our warriors! Glory to our people!, Glory to our Ukrainian strong world, our independence, our nation!, Glory to all of you!, Glory to Ukraine!"
24 August 2022  - 21:21 ,We all have to make Russia recognize that the inviolability of borders and peace are unconditional values for all nations - speech by the President of Ukraine at the meeting of the UN Security Council,", I am thankful to everyone present for this opportunity, for your support!, Greetings from independent and free Ukraine! But from Ukraine, which is still forced to fight for its freedom against Russian terror., Just now, on my way to deliver this address, I received information about a Russian missile attack on the Dnipropetrovsk region, on the railway station, directly on the cars at the Chaplyne station, four passenger cars are on fire... As of now, at least 15 people have been killed, about 50 have been wounded. Rescuers are working. But, unfortunately, the number of dead may still increase., This is how we live every day. This is how Russia prepared for this meeting of the UN Security Council., Ladies and Gentlemen!, Mr. President!, Mr. Secretary-General!, Dear members of the UN Security Council - all those who respect and adhere to the UN Charter!, Today, our state celebrates the main national holiday - Independence Day. And now you all see how many things in the world are dependent precisely on the independence of our state, on whether Ukraine is at peace, whether our people are safe, whether the integrity of our territory and the inviolability of our borders are guaranteed., You can take any aspect of the terrible war that Russia has unleashed against us, and in every such aspect there will be the roots of one global crisis or another., What exactly is happening now?, Russia has put the world on the brink of a radiation disaster. It is a fact that the Russian military made the territory of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe - the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - a combat zone. This is a fact., Because of Russia's armed provocations, because of shelling, because of the deployment of terrorists under the Russian flag on the territory of the plant. Now all of Europe and all neighboring regions are under the threat of radiation pollution. This is a fact., Who among you has forgotten what Chornobyl is? The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant consists of six reactors. One reactor exploded in Chornobyl., The IAEA mission must take permanent control of the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as soon as possible, and Russia must unconditionally stop nuclear blackmail and completely leave the plant., Russia has put the world on the brink of an unprecedented famine. It is a fact that the Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov has increased the deficit in the already destabilized food market. And this is against the background of the terrible climatic situation in different parts of the planet - you can take the drought in Europe alone, the largest in 500 years., Fortunately, we managed to achieve such conditions under which Russia was forced to accept the terms of the international community, and thanks to this, grain exports from three Ukrainian ports were restored. This already relieves part of the tension in the food market, but does not remove the threat completely., Only the full recovery of Ukrainian agricultural exports without any obstacles can be a guarantee that tens of millions of people around the world will have something to eat., And don't you resent the fact that even now, in the XXI century, we still have to fight to save tens of millions of people in different countries from artificial famine, precisely artificial famine, which was provoked by one state with its insane aggression? And this is also a fact., Ukrainians are outraged. The UN was not created to discuss in the XXI century something that should have long remained in the past., But, nevertheless, I am thankful to the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Guterres, and Türkiye, Mr. President, as well as all other conscientious subjects of international relations who are fighting against the food crisis, which only Russia is responsible for., And in the coming weeks, we must do everything to expand the existing grain export initiative., Let’s take another aspect - energy. It is a fact that Russia is deliberately trying to bring tens of millions of people into energy poverty. Deprive them of normal access to basic goods by deliberately raising energy prices., And this is done by a permanent member of the UN Security Council, who still has the privilege of veto! Energy crisis for Europe, threat of large-scale famine, political chaos for African and Asian countries, price crisis for the whole world. Isn’t too much allowed to one state, whose representative is sitting among you?, And I will mention one more aspect - values., Yes, indeed, we should be honest about the fact that values are perceived differently in different parts of the world. They look at it differently. But everywhere in the world, life has value. Peace has value. Economic prosperity has value., All states, if they respect themselves and their people, punish murder and do not honor torturers. However, we see that there is a state that not just behaves differently, but that is proud to behave differently. It awards murderers, encourages torturers., And this is a threat not only for Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainians were killed by the Russian invaders. Dozens of our cities were destroyed by Russian artillery. Russia does not adhere to basic conventions regarding prisoners of war. This was also discussed today., The deliberate murder by the Russian occupiers of our prisoners of war in Olenivka became one of the most dreadful pages in the history of Europe. And there is an urgent need for a UN fact-finding mission to Olenivka, whose mandate should be extended to all Ukrainian prisoners of war currently held by Russian forces., There is no war crime that the Russian occupiers have not yet committed on the territory of our independent state. But if we do not stop Russia now in Ukraine, if we do not stop it with the victory of Ukraine, all these Russian murderers will inevitably end up in other countries., Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America - traces of Russian war criminals are everywhere already, and we must all unite and act as resolutely as possible so that there are no more traces of Russian missiles and cities burned by Russian artillery anywhere else., So that there is never again a threat of a radiation disaster, Russia must leave the occupied territory of Ukraine., So that there is never a food crisis again, Russia must leave our land and our sea., So that no country in the world can ever again disregard the UN Charter and conventions binding on all mankind, without exception for anyone - Russia must be held accountable for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. The relevant resolution will be submitted for consideration by the 77th session of the UN General Assembly., In order for a sense of justice to return to international relations, we must all confirm and force Russia to recognize that the inviolability of borders and peace are unconditional values for all nations., That is why the independence and integrity of our state are of fundamental importance for international relations. Preserving our independence, guaranteeing our security, returning normal economic ties with Ukraine will restore the true power of the UN Charter and save the world from the crises we are all forced to experience now., Mr. Secretary-General, Distinguished António Guterres, has the ambitious intention of organizing the Summit of the Future next year. We support this intention. And we emphasize: in order to build the future, it is necessary to leave in the trashbox of history what has always prevented humanity from living in peace, namely aggression and colonial ambitions. That is, what Russia came to Ukraine with., And I believe that we will really be able to build the future. It would be very nice and symbolic for such a Summit to take place in Ukraine. As it is on our territory, on the territory of Ukraine, that it is now being decided whether we will have a future at all, whether the world will have a future at all. This is being decided at the Zaporizhzhia NPP, in our seaports, in Donbas and in Crimea., Our independence is your security. The security of the entire free world., I thank you very much for this opportunity, for understanding my situation, the situation of our country. Thank you! I am grateful to the Chinese Presidency for the opportunity to participate in this meeting in an online format., Glory to Ukraine!"
24 August 2022  - 09:07 ,Speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Independence Day of Ukraine,", The free people of independent Ukraine!, And that says it all. Just four words, but how much is behind them today. On the 182nd day of the full-scale war. How many symbols and meanings, feats and losses, joy and pain are in these words. And mainly how much truth is in them. Our truth. Truth about our present, with which it is impossible to argue, as it is impossible not to see and not to admit. We are the free people of independent Ukraine. After six months of the attempts to destroy us, we are the free people of independent Ukraine. And this is the truth about our future. The free people of independent Ukraine., Six months ago, Russia declared war against us. On February 24, the entire Ukraine heard explosions and gunshots. And on August 24, it wasn’t supposed to hear the words ""Happy Independence Day"". On February 24, we were told: you have no chance. On August 24, we say: Happy Independence Day, Ukraine!, During these six months, we changed history, changed the world and changed ourselves. Now we know for sure who is really our brother and friend, and who is not even a casual acquaintance. Who did not lose his name and reputation, and who worried for the terrorists to save face. Who doesn't really need us, and where the door is really open for us. We understood who is who. And the whole world learned who Ukrainians are. What Ukraine is. No one will say about it anymore: it is somewhere over there, near Russia., We started to respect ourselves. We understood that despite any help and support, no one but us will fight for our independence. And we united., We didn't have HIMARS yet, but we had people willing to stop tanks with their bare hands. They were not ready to close the sky for us, but we had people willing to cover their native land with themselves., The Ukrainian people and their courage inspired the whole world. They gave humanity a new hope that justice has not completely left our cynical world. And it is still not force that wins in it, but truth. Not money, but values. Not oil, but people., Yesterday the world was not united. COVID-19 clearly showed: it's every man for himself. Ukraine has changed this in six months. All world history textbooks will have a section ""Times when Ukraine united the world"". When democracy grew teeth again. When tyranny receives an answer in the language it understands., Someone said: Europe is no longer a player. Weak, disunited, passive, sleepy. Ukraine invigorated the whole continent. Europe takes to the squares. Europe introduces tough sanctions. Europe unanimously recognizes that Ukraine is a future member of the European Union., Big business realized that money still smells. With blood, cinder, death. Corporations and brands are leaving the Russian market, and people have become more important than potential losses., Never before in the world has public opinion had such an influence on politicians. Today, people dictate trends and rules of behavior to the authorities. Being indifferent, inactive and slow is a shame. Being indecisive and too cautious is a shame. Speaking sluggishly, vaguely and too diplomatically is a shame. Not supporting Ukraine is a shame. And saying about fatigue from Ukraine is a shame. This is a very comfortable position: fatigue is a cover to close your eyes. And today we hear from world leaders and ordinary citizens: we will be with you until the end, until your victory., Dear people!, We always paid tribute to all the fighters for independence, called this day the main holiday, and the blue-yellow flag - a shrine, put our hands to our hearts while singing the national anthem, and proudly said ""Glory to Ukraine!"" and ""Glory to Heroes!"". On February 24, we had to prove our words with deeds., On this day, the second all-Ukrainian referendum actually took place. Again - the main question. Again - a decisive choice. But this time it was necessary to say ""yes"" to independence not in the ballot, but in the soul and conscience. Go not to the precinct, but to the military commissariat departments, the territorial defense units, the volunteer movement, the information troops or simply work steadily and conscientiously in your place, at full strength, for a common goal., We all changed. Someone was born again. As a person, individual, citizen, patriot, simply as a Ukrainian. And this, of course, is good news. Someone disappeared. Did not perish, did not die, but dissolved. As a person, individual, citizen, as a Ukrainian. And this is actually not bad news either. We will not hinder each other anymore., We made a choice. For some, it is Mariupol. For some - Monaco. But we know who the majority is. And we finally became truly one. A new nation that emerged on February 24 at 4 am. Not born, but reborn. A nation that didn't cry, didn't scream, didn't get scared. Didn't run away. Didn't give up. Didn't forget., This flag will be everywhere it should be by right. Both in Donbas and in Crimea. The enemy thought we would greet him with flowers and champagne. Instead, he received wreaths and Molotov cocktails. He was waiting for an ovation, but hears ""claps""., The occupier believed that in a few days he would be on parade in our capital’s downtown. Today, you can see this ""parade"" on Khreshchatyk. The proof that enemy equipment can appear in the center of Kyiv only in such form. Burnt, wrecked and destroyed., It doesn't matter to us what kind of army you have, what matters to us is our land. We will fight for it until the end., We are holding on for six months. It is difficult for us, but we clenched our fists fighting for our fate. Every new day is a new reason not to give up. Because, having gone through so much, we have no right not to reach the end. What is the end of the war for us? We used to say: peace. Now we say: victory., We will not seek an understanding with the terrorists. Although we understand the Russian language that you came to defend. And killed thousands of people you came to liberate., And Johnson, who speaks English, is much more understandable and close to us than murderers, rapists and looters who did it in Russian., And we don't sit down at the negotiating table because of fear, with a gun pointed at our head. For us, the most terrible iron is not missiles, aircraft and tanks, but shackles. Not trenches, but fetters., And we will put our hands up only once - when we will celebrate our victory. The whole of Ukraine. Because we do not trade our lands and our people. For us, Ukraine is all of Ukraine. All 25 regions, without any concessions or compromises. We do not know these words, they were destroyed by missiles on February 24., Donbas is Ukraine. And we will return it, whatever the path may be. Crimea is Ukraine. And we will return it. Whatever the path may be. You don't want your soldiers to die? Free our lands. You don't want your mothers to cry? Free our lands. These are our simple and clear terms., The free people of independent Ukraine!, We are facing this day in different places. Someone is in trenches and dugouts, in tanks and IFVs, at sea and in the air. Fighting for independence on the frontline. Someone is on the road, in cars, trucks and trains. Fighting for independence by delivering what is necessary to those on the frontline. And someone is on a smartphone or on a computer. Also fighting for independence by raising funds so that those on the road have something to bring to those on the frontline., We are facing this day in different circumstances, conditions and even in different time zones, but with one goal - preservation of independence and victory of Ukraine!, We united., Happy Independence Day of Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
23 August 2022  - 20:49 ,"This day has shown how strong our state has become, and this is not the limit yet - address by the President of Ukraine",", Ukrainians!, All our defenders!, Today was a useful day for Ukraine, very meaningful. A day that showed how strong our state has become, and this is not the limit yet. We are doing everything so that the strength of Ukraine, the opportunities of Ukraine, the freedom of Ukraine only increase., Today we celebrate the day of our flag, and it happens at a time when we are fighting against the most dreadful threat to our statehood and at the same time when we have achieved the greatest national unity. That is why we endured. Because we united and united the world around true values., Our national flag has become a global symbol of courage. A symbol of all who value a free life. Where there is blue and yellow, there is no and will be no tyranny. Where there is blue and yellow, there are no and will not be savages., Our flag is everywhere - from the frontline, where our warriors beat the enemy, to capitals on all continents, and it means one thing everywhere - humanity., I am grateful to everyone who defends true values. I am grateful to everyone who helps Ukraine. I am grateful to everyone who, since February 24, has chosen the path of struggle for what makes life real: for freedom, for independence., Very soon we will celebrate our main national holiday - our independence. Already tomorrow. We have planned many activities - something that will emphasize the path we have covered. Covered together - Ukrainians in Ukraine, throughout our territory - free and temporarily occupied, because our people are fighting everywhere. Ukrainians abroad - all those who helped, all those who spread the truth about Ukraine, all those who urged to fight for Ukraine., No occupier feels safe on our land. All collaborators know that they have no future. And we all do not just believe - we see that our state has a perspective., And for tomorrow, I have planned to award people who have contributed to our strength. These are people from different areas of life. Our warriors, all those who help warriors. Communication officers, railwaymen, rescuers, media workers, those who inform our people, who work in the national marathon ""United News"". These are utility workers, electricians, drivers, volunteers, officials, athletes, artists - those artists who are known on the frontline, whom the army is grateful to, those who preserve and restore the positive emotions of our warriors., I asked various ministries, regional administrations, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, media representatives to submit their proposals on who deserves awards on Independence Day. It is up to you to decide. And tomorrow the awards will be given to those who really deserve them., Now I am near the office of the Crimea Platform, near the building that symbolizes that we care about every part of Ukraine, about every part of our people - the great Ukrainian people. Crimea is an integral part of our state, Crimea is Ukraine. Crimea is an integral part of our people. And we will certainly come to our cities in Crimea, to our people in Crimea and return to them the freedom that belongs to them by right, as well as to all our other people., That is why we have organized a special format - the Crimean format, the Crimea Platform. We held the inaugural summit last summer and today we have already held the second one. I am grateful to all participants of the summit - 40 leaders, almost 60 states and international organizations. European leaders, leaders of the G7, leaders of the countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America. This is not just a meeting, not just a discussion. The Crimea Platform became a global forum that united the leaders of the free world. This is a community of people who help restore peace and legality for Crimea, for the Black Sea region, for all of Europe., And the fact that we are holding the summit for the second time right now, with the expansion of the representation, is a clear response of the world to Russian aggression. Clear support for our sovereignty and territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders. Russian aggression began in Crimea, and its finale will be in Crimea as well., In Kyiv, on Constitution Square, the Walk of the Brave was opened today - a place to honor the personal strength of those people who did not fail after February 24, who were not afraid, who did not retreat under the pressure of tyranny. Who helped us fight against Russian aggression and is still helping us. And the first name that we presented on the Walk of the Brave is the name of Andrzej Duda, the President of Poland. He was in Kyiv today, participating in the Crimea Platform. And for not a single day during these six months has he lost strength in supporting Ukraine. I am grateful to him!, I definitely want to address our Kharkiv and all Kharkiv residents separately today. You are heroic people, a heroic city. A proud city. A city with a sense of self-respect. A city that knows how to defend itself. A city whose people know how to unite. A neat city. A city that always impresses everyone who comes and sees how Kharkiv residents take care of their streets and yards even when they are under the brutal pressure of Russian terrorists., Today is Kharkiv Day. Now our Kharkiv is not willing to celebrate. Yes, Kharkiv experienced a lot of injustice and cruelty. But Kharkiv will never be a city of black scorched windows and ruined districts. Kharkiv will never submit to this evil, which has nothing but artillery and missiles., We will definitely liberate the entire Kharkiv region. We will find a way to guarantee security to our Kharkiv. And we will do everything to restore the city. I promise!, Fellow Ukrainians!, Tomorrow is an important day for all of us. And that is why this day, unfortunately, is also important for our enemy. We must be aware that tomorrow hideous Russian provocations and brutal strikes are possible., The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence, special services will do everything to protect people - as much as possible. And we will certainly respond to any manifestation of Russian terror., But please follow the safety rules strictly tomorrow. Please observe the curfew. Pay attention to the air sirens. Pay attention to official announcements. And remember: we must all achieve victory together., Eternal glory to all who fight for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
23 August 2022  - 17:05 ,Everything started with Crimea and will end with it - liberation of the peninsula from occupation is necessary - speech by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the opening of the Second Crimea Platform Summit,", Ladies and Gentlemen!, Dear participants and guests of the Crimea Platform, present here and there, not far from us, and we feel it!, Dear citizens of Ukraine from Crimea and in Crimea., I know you are watching and hearing us today. It is very important for us. It is very important for me. For society, for each and every one of us. I know that Crimea stands with Ukraine and is waiting for us to return. I want you all to know, we will definitely be back. When we return and correct everything that the occupiers did on our Ukrainian peninsula., What has come to Crimea and the entire Black Sea region along with Russian aggression and Russian weapons? Catastrophic environmental threats, unprecedented destruction of Crimea's nature, destruction of social life, economic decline, destruction of monuments, militarism. And when the Russian fleet, which is based in the occupied Crimea, blocked our ports in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, it provoked a global food crisis and the crisis of the rights of people - Crimeans, our wonderful citizens, citizens of our unitary state of Ukraine., But - in spite of everything, in spite of any threats - Ukraine is strong enough and capable enough to see a perspective for the Ukrainian Crimea., I have the honor to announce the start of the Second Summit of the Crimea Platform., In a year, we managed to significantly expand the capabilities of the Crimea Platform, Minister Kuleba mentioned that. Last year, 46 foreign countries and international organizations participated in the summit. This year the figure is almost 60. I am grateful to everyone. Much more state leaders - 40 presidents and prime ministers, including the leaders of the G7. I am grateful to all of you for understanding how important such actions are now - your support, our joint actions and our joint work., This year, representatives of two more continents - Africa and South America - have joined, and this demonstrates that there is no boundary in the world that the truth about the Russian war against Ukraine and our people would not overcome., Of course, it is obvious whom we have to fight. The presence of obvious security risks dictates that the summit takes place in online mode. But international practice has already proven that such a regime can be absolutely effective for politics, diplomacy, and most importantly, for the protection of freedom., And especially now I want to thank one of the leaders who is with us here in Kyiv today - Andrzej Duda, the President of Poland and a true friend of all Ukrainians. Andrzej, your presence next to me, next to the people of Ukraine, once again confirms the extremely close ties and historical understanding that exist between Ukrainians and Poles. Thank you!, Ladies and Gentlemen!, When I speak to our citizens, I often use the honorific address: all our defenders. In fact, today, addressing you, honorable leaders, honorable ministers, I can use the same words and with a related meaning: all defenders of the international legal order!, This is why we are here today, this is why the Crimea Platform was established and has been working for a year already., We are restoring the power of international law, and it is thanks to this that we will return the Ukrainian flag to our land of Crimea, it is thanks to this that we will bring freedom to Ukrainian citizens in Crimea and certainly restore justice for all those who suffered from repression and abuse by the Russian occupiers., But to win, we must not forget the path that led to the current situation., The degradation of Russia began with the seizure of Crimea. It started with terror against the Crimean Tatar people, the indigenous people of Crimea. With repression on religious grounds, which probably became the largest religious persecution in Europe in the XXI century, against the Crimean Muslim community., There was also the expulsion from occupied Crimea of all ordinary people who said that Crimea is Ukraine, who were not afraid to defend Ukrainian culture and Ukrainian freedom in Crimea. Murders and torture - we saw it all - humiliation and looting - the occupiers committed all this in Crimea and continue to commit all this since the first weeks after its shameful capture. And then they spread these crimes to Donbas, to other countries, in particular to Syria, to African countries, where Russian banditry under the cover of Russian special services is now seen., Mass terror after February 24 became the logical completion of the degradation of this state, which not so long ago was invited to the table with the G7 and which now competes for supremacy with the most brutal regimes of the past, responsible for genocides, wars of aggression and deportations., We are grateful that many people in the world did not keep silent about all this, many people constantly resisted - helped us, fought. But at the same time, many remained silent - and it is true - tried not to notice what was happening in Crimea. And this, in my opinion, became one of the key reasons for everything that is happening now in Ukraine and in the world., It is important to remember that there was resistance on the peninsula. There were and are people, we know, who are not silent, who defend freedom and simply defend normal life in Crimea. They are oppressed. But we see them, we know about them, we are grateful to them., I recently received a letter from one of the qırımlılar, Nariman Celâl. Unfortunately, he is now behind bars. The occupiers imprisoned him on a completely false charge, for fighting for the homeland, for taking part in the first summit of the Crimea Platform, which took place last year. Last year, he left the already occupied Crimea to tell the participants of the summit what is really happening on the peninsula and what it all will lead to. And nine days after his return to Crimea, the occupiers deprived him of his freedom. For the fact that he was simply a free man. This was Russia's response., In his letter, Mr. Celâl wrote: ""It began with Crimea, and it will end with Crimea."" And it really will. I believe in it. In order to overcome terror, to return predictability and security to our region, Europe and the whole world, we need to win the fight against Russian aggression, and therefore we need to free Crimea from occupation. It will end where it began., And this will be an effective resuscitation of the international legal order., But this is not just a political and legal task for the world. This is about a specific land, about specific people living in Crimea. About cities, about culture, about specific landmarks. About hopes of specific living people. About the fact that someone invested his life in Crimea, and after the arrival of Russia, was forced to leave it and seek refuge in other lands, or fear that something of his own would be taken away: a house, land, work, any business... And he was forced to limit himself. Or lose everything when it was taken., Russia stole a part of life even from those in Crimea who were lucky enough not to become a victim of repression. It was impossible to imagine such a thing, but the occupation turned Crimea - which is a paradise for all of us - into a depressed and dependent region. Into a region of high fences, barbed wire and lawlessness. Into a zone of environmental disaster and a military bridgehead for aggression and the spread of grief., Since February 24, 750 different cruise missiles have been launched from the occupied Crimea at our cities and communities. Imagine - 750 in six months! They destroyed at least hundreds of civilian objects: schools, universities, ordinary residential buildings, hospitals., And that is why Ukraine's restoration of control over the Crimean peninsula will be a historic anti-war step in Europe., This will restore security and provide justice, this will reintegrate Crimea into the modern world, and this will allow each of us - participants of the Crimea Platform - to tell our children, our relatives and friends that they can be proud of us precisely as peacekeepers., And I want to emphasize: for Ukraine, Crimea is not just some territory, not a chip in the geopolitical game, as for a terrorist state. For Ukraine, Crimea is a part of our people, our society. A community of people to whom we will guarantee freedom and restore modernity., Crimea was and is Ukraine, and after deoccupation, along with our entire state, it will become part of the European Union. I am sure of that. The passport of a citizen of Ukraine will also be the passport of the European Union. These are colossal opportunities for all our people living in Crimea., The roads of Crimea will be the roads of the entire European continent, the ports of Crimea will be the ports of all of Europe. Only Ukraine can connect Simferopol with Berlin, and Yalta with Naples., Only Ukraine is concerned about the real security of Crimea. That is, a normal supply of clean water, normal disposal of garbage, effective rules for waste and sewage management., Only Ukraine can build a modern irrigation system in Crimea and integrate Crimean agricultural production and the entire business sector into the colossal European market., Only our state will provide Crimea with a modern and affordable medical system, a modern and affordable educational system, and a modern digital system of public services., Ukraine will remove the barbed wire that blocks the path of ordinary people to the best locations, and the illegal fences that have torn the coast of our beautiful Crimea. Free access to beaches, real protection of protected areas, historical sites - this will be provided only by Ukraine, not by someone who came to capture, steal and humiliate people., It is Ukraine that will restore the system of sanatoria and rehabilitation centers in Crimea - professional institutions that will be able to host hundreds of thousands of people annually. Millions of tourists. Children and adults, civilians and veterans, our citizens and foreigners - everyone whom the precious nature of Crimea helps. And millions of tourists - at least of the middle class - can come to Crimea stably only thanks to Ukraine., There will never be repressions under the Ukrainian authorities in Crimea, and everyone knows that. The lack of freedom or moral suffocation that Russia brought in 2014. And even more so, Ukraine will never ignore the social needs of pensioners or anyone else in Crimea. Ukraine will never tell people: ""There is no money, but hold on"", because we respect people, and even this year, already in the bloody times of a full-scale war, we indexed pensions for all our pensioners., Ladies and Gentlemen!, I think you felt from my words that we have a very elaborated view of how to restore our Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea after the expulsion of the Russian invaders. That is why we are adding two more directions to the work of the Crimea Platform: economic and legislative directions., We have a strategy for the restoration of Crimea - today it will be presented as part of the economic panel., And we are creating a legislative foundation for Crimea - after deoccupation, as well as for all those for whom Crimea is much more than even home., We adopted the Law ""On Indigenous Peoples"", which protected the rights of the Crimean Tatar people and Mejlis, Karaites and Krymchaks. We are developing the Crimean Tatar language. A law was passed on the protection of political prisoners - all those who suffered from the repressions of the occupiers. And these are just some examples. We are not going to stop there - there is still a lot of work to do., This year, the Crimea Platform will be continued in the autumn - in Croatia - with a parliamentary summit. No longer online, with the presence of parliamentary delegations of the world. We use all the power of democracies to protect our state and the international legal order., And, returning to the letter of Nariman Celâl, who was imprisoned by the occupiers, I want to read a few more important words: ""Thanks to the change in the agenda on the world stage, in Europe and in Ukraine itself due to the aggression of the Russian Federation, the members of the Crimea Platform have a more determined attitude focused on the implementation of specific measures."", The person who was sent to jail by the occupiers only for defending the truth and participating in last year's Crimea Platform hopes for specific measures from all of us - participants of the summit. And we all must not deceive this hope. We all have to be strong and effective., Thank you for your attention!, I am grateful to each and every one for participating in our second summit, to everyone present on this platform., Glory to Ukraine!"
22 August 2022  - 21:57 ,"These days, if you are abroad, be there with the flag of Ukraine and spread the truth about the crimes of the occupiers - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, A report on the activity during the day., I took part in the work of a special forum of veterans. And announced changes in state policy regarding the veteran community - we must create more opportunities for veterans. Without such changes, without this reform, it is simply impossible., Veterans of the war for independence of Ukraine have become one of the most significant and respected groups in our society. With their specificity, with their needs, with their expectations, which must be responded to so that veterans can contribute not only to the defense of our state on the frontline, but also to the post-war development of Ukraine., And not only the state must react, but also business, which is very important, employers, education., We will create such a system of veteran policy and services for veterans, opportunities for their transition from military affairs to civilian life, which will be on a par with the strongest similar systems in the world. You can cite the example of the Israeli model, as well as the American one., But our goal is for the Ukrainian experience of veteran policy to eventually become a new example for others in the world to follow., I held a large meeting with representatives of the defense and security sector. Zaluzhny, Monastyrskyi, Danilov, Budanov and others were present. The key issues are, of course, the situation on the frontline, the security situation in big cities, as well as specific security measures due to the holidays and important political events this week - meetings, negotiations., We are already fully prepared for the second summit of the Crimea Platform. This year's summit will be even more powerful than last year, in terms of both the number of participants and the topics of discussion. We are significantly expanding the format of the Crimea Platform - tomorrow we will announce all the details., And today the new diplomatic and security format ""Kyiv Initiative"" was founded. Ukraine's European neighbors are already participating in its work. These are Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and the Baltic states. We will gradually involve other countries. In the ""Kyiv Initiative"" format, the work takes place at the level of foreign policy advisors to the heads of state. From the Ukrainian side, these are Andriy Sybiha and Andriy Yermak. And this format will allow us to strengthen cooperation in the region and joint protection of our interests, primarily security. This is a very promising line of our work in the Euro-Atlantic direction., Today there is good infrastructural news - the railway branch connecting Ukraine and Moldova has been upgraded and launched. Moreover, we did it both on our territory and on the territory of Moldova - our ""Ukrzaliznytsia"" did it, well done. This route has been closed for almost 25 years, and now it is working for Ukraine again. This is an important transport direction. And the average volume of cargo per year can be about 10 million tons. I am grateful to our partners from Moldova., Search operations at the site of the occupiers' attack on a residential building in Kharkiv have ended. The building was destroyed by Russian shelling last Wednesday. Only today we managed to get the bodies of all the dead from under the rubble. This Russian strike alone claimed the lives of 19 people. One strike. And savages have not stopped such strikes at different parts of our country for 180 days., The total number of various cruise missiles that Russia has used against us is approaching 3,500. It is simply impossible to count the strikes of Russian artillery - there are too many of them, they are too intense. And at the same time, the terrorist state does not stop playing around with international structures and once again has the audacity to convene the UN Security Council to discuss its own provocations, its own terror at the Zaporizhzhia NPP..., I am grateful to all European politicians who do not forget that the eighth sanctions package against Russia is needed. The longer the interval between sanctions packages is, the greater Russia's audacity is. And I am grateful to all our friends, all friends of freedom in different countries of the world, who promote the need to recognize the objective reality and legally define Russia as a terrorist state. This decision will come sooner or later, and the only question is how many more lives Russia will manage to take away before the retaliatory strikes from the international community become truly tangible for those responsible for this terror., And, dear Ukrainians, especially these days, when we celebrate the day of our flag and the day of our independence, if you are somewhere abroad, please remind about Ukraine there, be there with the Ukrainian flag and spread the truth about the crimes of the occupiers., Let's all stick together, no matter where we, Ukrainians, are!, Glory to all who protect the state!, Gratitude to everyone who fights for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
22 August 2022  - 00:45 ,Russia will cut itself off from negotiations if it organizes a show trial of captured Ukrainian defenders - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Good night, Ukrainians!, All our defenders!, The 180th day of our defense and a new week begin., The week we look forward to every year, as it is the time of our main holiday, the holiday of Ukraine - Independence Day. And this week the occupiers definitely did not expect to be such... They could not have imagined that even now, after six months of such a brutal war, we will celebrate our independence on our land and in our capital., But it is so. This is our land. This is our independence, which no one can break and no one can take away. And you know it is so. Everyone in Ukraine feels it. 180 days - almost six months - the absolute majority of our people have no doubt that we will achieve the victory of Ukraine., We are united, we are more confident now than we have been in many decades. And this is one of the foundations of our strength, our power., And therefore, it is one of the main targets for Russian terrorists. They strike at the feelings of Ukrainians, at the wounds in the souls of our people just as at our cities... They strike cruelly, cynically. But with a different weapon. And not only with propaganda, not only with lies. Tormenting people, all those who suffer the biggest pain, the greatest difficulties, is one of the terrible means of pressure, which has become commonplace for Russia., And now there are enough reports in the media that in Mariupol the scenery is being prepared for an absolutely disgusting and absurd show trial of Ukrainian defenders, of our warriors who are captives of the occupiers., No matter what the occupiers are thinking, no matter what they are planning, the reaction of our state will be absolutely clear. If this despicable show trial takes place, if our people are brought into this scenery in violation of all agreements, all international rules, if there is abuse... This will be the line beyond which any negotiations are impossible. Russia will cut itself off from the negotiations. There will be no more conversations. Our state has said everything., All partners of Ukraine have been informed about what the terrorist state can prepare for this week., Today I spoke with President Macron about all the threats. President of Türkiye Erdoğan is also informed about all this. The Secretary-General of the UN, I am sure, will also react. They and other world leaders received appropriate signals from us. Everyone understands everything. They understand what the occupiers are doing and what it threatens. And they understand that Ukraine will not tolerate this. It will not tolerate tormenting of people about whom only one thing can be said: they are heroes of their Homeland, they defended the freedom of their people from invaders on their land., Even in times of war, there must be rules. The power of the world is definitely enough to bring any state, any terrorist under the power of these rules., Well, all of us - all Ukrainians - must remember one thing: no matter what, our goal is victory., No matter what, we are heading towards victory in spite of everything., No matter what, glory to all our warriors!, Ukraine is above everything!, Glory to Ukraine!"
20 August 2022  - 21:22 ,"We still need to fight for victory, but Ukrainians can feel proud of themselves, their country and their heroes – address of President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians I wish you health!, We are actively preparing for the new week, which is very important for all of us, for our country. Our Flag Day, our Independence Day is ahead. The commemoration of veterans of the war for the freedom of Ukraine is ahead. The Crimean platform is ahead. This year it is really special. This year, one can literally feel in the air of Crimea that the occupation there is temporary, and Ukraine is returning., We will definitely remember our legends – this is and will be a Ukrainian tradition. Let us remember those whose lives have become a part of our national history, which can never be erased by anyone – by no enemy., Next week, as usual, important negotiations and visits of true friends of Ukraine are planned..., A significant milestone is ahead – six months of this full-scale invasion. The war that changed everything for Ukraine, for Europe, and for the world. Of course, there will be time to tell about it. And tell in detail. But let's still think today, take a look, assess the path we have taken. How much has been changed – what almost everyone in the world thought was impossible to change. How much it was managed to win, wrest from the Russian army, which for decades was thought to be invincible., I remember the first days of the full-scale invasion, I remember what various ""advisors"" told me and advised me then... I know that many of them are now ashamed of the words that were said then., Since February 24, during these 178 days, Ukrainians have proven that our people are invincible, our defenders are invincible. And I thank everyone who showed their strength during this time, I thank everyone who fought and is fighting for Ukraine, I thank everyone who fights and helps our soldiers, our state., Our unity, our faith in ourselves made it possible to pass these six months and approach this week, which is always important for every Ukrainian., We have always said and we say honestly: for the sake of Ukraine's victory, we still need to fight, we still need to do a lot, we still need to persevere and endure, unfortunately, a lot of pain., But Ukrainians can feel proud of themselves, their country, and their heroes. And let's all feel it together today - let's feel the power of our people, our beautiful people., This power has always been and will be – as long as we believe in ourselves, as long as we preserve our unity, as long as we fight for Ukraine, and as long as we work for our common Ukrainian victory., We should be aware that this week Russia may try to do something particularly nasty, something particularly cruel. Such is our enemy. But in any other week during these six months, Russia did the same thing all the time – disgusting and cruel., One of the key tasks of the enemy is to humiliate us, Ukrainians, to devalue our capabilities, our heroes, to spread despair, fear, to spread conflicts... Therefore, it is important never, for a single moment, to give in to this enemy pressure, not to wind oneself up, not to show weakness., We must all be strong enough to resist any enemy provocations – as much as it takes to make the occupiers answer for all their blows and terror – for Kharkiv and Donbas, for Azovstal and Mykolaiv, for the filtration camps, for Bucha , Irpin for all cities... We must all be strong enough to endure and go all the way to Ukrainian victory., That's why we stay together! We help each other! We restore the destroyed! We fight for all our people. And we cheer for those who represent Ukraine, today – definitely for Usyk, our boy!, We believe in ourselves! We believe in Ukraine!, Glory to each and every one of you!, Glory to Ukraine!"
19 August 2022  - 22:43 ,The restoration of full security at the ZNPP and Enerhodar can begin with the mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - address by the President of Ukraine,", Ukrainians!, All Europeans!, For 177 days already, the report on the events in Ukraine is important for the entire continent., Ukrainian diplomats, our partners, representatives of the UN and the IAEA are working out the specific details of the mission to be sent to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. With this mission, the restoration of full security at the ZNPP and in Enerhodar can begin. And I am grateful to everyone who joined this work and initiative., If Russian blackmail with radiation continues, this summer may go down in the history of various European countries as one of the most tragic of all time. Because not a single instruction at any nuclear power plant in the world envisages a procedure in case a terrorist state turns a nuclear power plant into a target., Of course, today it is worth paying attention to another aspect of Russian blackmail in the field of energy. Gas supplies to Germany via the first Nord Stream are again being restricted and absurd statements are being made again that it is allegedly possible to compensate for something via Nord Stream 2. These ""streams"" are needed by Russia exclusively to supply problems to Europe, not to help someone there with gas. Now it is absolutely obvious., The longer the terrorist state remains on the European and world energy market, the longer it will not be stable. And the sooner everyone in Europe prepares their energy systems to exist without any supply of energy carriers from Russia, the sooner they will be able to calmly go through any winter., Today there was a very important visit to Ukraine by Eurocities representatives led by the mayor of Florence. This Association unites the mayors of more than 150 European cities, as well as representatives of dozens of other partner cities., We will cooperate with them directly - Ukrainian cities and communities with European cities and communities., The key issue is, of course, the rebuilding of our cities. The relevant memorandum was signed today. But not only this will be the subject of our important cooperation., The modern development of any country is primarily the development of cities, the creation of new opportunities and institutions in cities, the exchange of experience between cities and urban institutions. And therefore, these are new jobs, greater social capital and higher level of security for people., On the Ukrainian side, the subject of relations with the Association of European Cities will be our Congress of Local and Regional Authorities. I want to assure that every city of our state will benefit from this. We are interested in sustainable development throughout the territory of Ukraine - and it will be so. Without any exceptions., And today I want to address separately the residents of all our cities of Ukraine, which are subjected to constant brutal shelling by Russia. Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, all the cities of Donbas, the Dnipropetrovsk region, the Zaporizhzhia region... All those who experience this constant horror of the destruction of life and the destruction of everything that gives life normality. We will not leave any of these strikes unanswered. We will establish the identity of every occupier who gives orders and executes these strikes at cities. And we will bring them all to justice in one way or another. No murderer will hide., And we will certainly restore everything that the terrorists try to leave in ruins. The word ""ruins"" will never be a word about Ukraine, will never be a word about our cities. Russia will definitely not succeed in this., Eternal glory to all who bring our victory closer!, Eternal glory to all who fight for our beautiful, strong Ukraine, for our people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
18 August 2022  - 21:06 ,We can and should think only about how to win - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today we are in Lviv, the Potocki Palace, now. At the end of this very busy day, here’s my report on events, meetings, negotiations and decisions., We have been here since the morning. And once again I want to thank the city of Lviv, all Lviv residents for the attention, comfort and emotional support felt throughout the day., First of all, I paid a visit to our defenders - those who are being treated after injuries in the hospital. Very brave guys, strong. I thanked the doctors who are doing everything to restore the health of our warriors as soon as possible., I was very happy to see the boys and girls studying at the Petro Sahaidachnyi National Ground Forces Academy. It was extremely pleasant to hear that more and more people want to become officers of the Ukrainian army. The competition for one place in the academy is of such a scale that used to be only in civilian universities before. And this really gives a reason to be proud not just of the patriotism of our youth, but of the fact that people believe in Ukraine, in our Armed Forces, in our victory. I presented awards to the best warriors., During a special ceremony on the Field of Mars of the Lychakiv Cemetery, we honored the memory of all those who gave their lives for Ukraine and for the independence of our country in this brutal war., There is no other alternative - we must return everything of ours and guarantee security for all future generations of Ukraine., I held talks with UN Secretary-General Guterres and President of Türkiye Erdoğan., Most of the points discussed are already in the news. I want to say a few main things now., First. There are no objective obstacles to prevent the IAEA mission from reaching the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Today, Mr. Guterres and I discussed the parameters of this mission and the fact that it can get to the plant very quickly and quite safely in a legal way through the free territory of our state. And just like that., The one who organized nuclear blackmail certainly cannot be the ""transporter"" of any such missions. Russia must immediately and unconditionally allow IAEA representatives to the plant and also immediately and unconditionally withdraw its troops from the territory of the plant. The world has the power to ensure this., If it does not ensure this, we can simply throw the entire body of international documents on nuclear and radiation safety into the trash. Russia is destroying this international order., The second extremely important point of the negotiations is Ukrainian prisoners of war held by the Russian Federation., I called on Mr. Secretary-General to use all the capabilities of the UN to ensure Russia's compliance with all norms of international law regarding prisoners of war. And we discussed sending a fact-finding mission to Olenivka. The full truth about this Russian terrorist attack must and will be established., Of course, we talked about the grain export initiative. The result is there - and not only for Ukraine, but also for the world, as it is felt that the severity of the global food crisis is decreasing., Therefore, there is a great need for more security, a greater volume of exports, more ships that can deliver Ukrainian food from our ports., I held very substantive negotiations on many topics today with President of Türkiye Erdoğan. I am grateful to him for his unwavering support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state. We discussed defense, economic and energy cooperation., I am grateful to Türkiye for its willingness to take under patronage the reconstruction of Kharkiv and the Kharkiv region. This is a mission for a truly powerful country. Today, the first step was taken - an agreement on infrastructure was signed., I called on both Mr. President and Mr. Secretary-General to voice the strictest possible position regarding Russia's planned pseudo-referendums in the occupied territory. Any pseudo-referendum will be a slap in the face of the international community., And I want to mention one more thing today., It was an extremely hard night in Kharkiv - more than ten people died. Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia were again shelled. The Russian army is spending enormous resources to capture at least one more kilometer in Donbas. Russian officials reiterate threats to Odesa and other cities of Ukraine. We see what is happening at the Zaporizhzhia NPP. We see what happened in Olenivka., We can and should think only about how to win. To win on the battlefield, on the political front, in the information confrontation, in the economic plane, everywhere..., Let’s believe in ourselves, help each other, protect the interests of Ukraine and know that there will be peace., He who fights and fights wisely wins., Eternal glory to all our warriors! Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken away by the occupiers., Glory to Ukraine!"
17 August 2022  - 21:41 ,Only absolute transparency and controlled situation at and around ZNPP can guarantee return to normal nuclear safety – address of President of Ukraine,", Dear Ukrainians!, Diplomacy in the interests of our country is very active these days. First of all, today a ceremony of presenting credentials to the new ambassadors of foreign countries who arrived to work in our capital was held in the Sophia of Kyiv. The work of embassies in full capacity, the presence of ambassadors in Kyiv is one of the important indicators of the strength of our state, the Ukrainian ability to fight and win. Already 55 diplomatic missions have resumed their work. And today, the new ambassadors of Belgium, Spain, Kyrgyzstan and Romania presented their credentials., Secondly, UN Secretary General António Guterres has already arrived in Ukraine. We will work to get the necessary results for Ukraine., Thirdly, Ukrainian diplomats, our nuclear scientists and the IAEA are in constant touch, now they are working on sending the IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Only absolute transparency and controlled situation at and around the ZNPP can guarantee a gradual return to normal nuclear safety for the Ukrainian state, for the international community, and for the IAEA., The Russian army must withdraw from the territory of the nuclear power plant and all neighboring areas, and take away its military equipment from the plant. This must happen without any conditions and as soon as possible. Ukraine is ready to ensure proper control of the IAEA, and the relevant mission can be sent to the Zaporizhzhia plant in a legal way, very fast and as efficiently as possible., Today, I made a very important address to the university communities, journalists and political circles of Chile and Latin America in general. This is not an easy direction of foreign policy – we are doing many things there now practically from scratch. We are working not only at the political level, but also establishing relations directly with the societies of the countries of this region. I called on Chileans and all freedom-loving people in Latin America to spread the truth about Russia's war against our country and to support the sanctions policy aimed at making the terrorist state pay the highest possible price for terror., In the evening, I signed new decrees on awarding our soldiers. 230 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were given state awards, 43 of them posthumously. Also, 24 employees of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine were awarded state awards., All our soldiers – our army, our intelligence, border guards, the National Guard, the SBU and everyone involved in defending our state and people are doing everything possible to fight Russian terrorists and push them out of Ukrainian land., The Avdiyivka area, Bakhmut area, Kharkiv region, and some other regions are the regions where the most difficult fighting is going on right now. I am grateful to everyone who withstands this pressure, who defends positions and helps our soldiers. In Zaporizhzhia region, in some areas of the south of the country, the occupiers are trying to improve their situation, but strategically it is hopeless for them. Ukrainian soldiers will destroy the potential of the occupiers step by step, and the day will come when the enemy will die in Zaporizhzhia, in the south, in the east of the country, and in Crimea. The invaders will die like dew on the sun, and our defense is and will be this sun., Eternal glory to all who defend Ukraine!, Eternal gratitude to all those who focused on helping our people in a true Ukrainian unity!, Glory to Ukraine!"
17 August 2022  - 21:33 ,"Russia deliberately deepening crisis of cost of living in many countries, that is why we must jointly resist its aggression – address of President of Ukraine to university community of Chile",", Dear Mr. Rector!, Dear students and university teachers who joined our conversation today!, Dear journalists and everyone present!, I am grateful for the opportunity to address you and tell you what is happening in Ukraine and why the Russian war against our country is still going on. Why there is no peace., A full-scale war, a full-scale Russian invasion of the territory of Ukraine has been going on for 175 days. For 175 days, millions of Ukrainians have defended the independence of our state., But not only independence. This is a struggle not only for the state and not only for the opportunity of our people to independently decide their future., Indeed, the primary motive of Russian aggression against Ukrainians is purely colonialist – the Russian leadership wants its domination over Ukrainian land and over our resources. And for a long time it was heard in Moscow that they would not restore the Russian empire without seizing the territory of Ukraine., However, it became a much deeper struggle than any imperial or geopolitical intentions. Russia is literally waging a war against the lives of our people, against the very right to life of Ukrainians., And this war started not 175 days ago. On February 24 of this year, Russia switched to massive aggression – to attacks from the north, from the east, and from the south at once; all our ports on the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov were blocked; massive missile strikes were launched throughout the territory of Ukraine., But it was a continuation of the war. The war that began in 2014. It began when Russia occupied the Crimean peninsula, ignited the confrontation in Donbas, which claimed thousands of lives. They were thousands., Therefore, when we talk about Russia's war against Ukraine, we are talking about eight years and 175 days. And when we talk about the victims of this war, about Ukrainian losses, we do not start the story from February 2022. We start it in 2014, when Ukrainians began to be killed simply because they were Ukrainians., For the Ukrainian flag. For a pro-Ukrainian position. For defending the Ukrainian territory. Even simply for the suspicion that a person supports the Ukrainian state., Today I want to tell you about one such person. About a guy who would have turned 25 this fall, and he would probably be a lot like you right now., His name was Stepan Chubenko. He was from the city of Kramatorsk in Donbas. Bright young man. He was remembered as kind and very active – if he had entered a university similar to yours, he would probably have become one of the student leaders. Perhaps he would not have betrayed his dream and chosen the path of a sports career – and he would have been able to become the goalkeeper of one of the teams you know., I ask you to look at these photos now – that's the kind of guy he was., He was killed on July 27, 2014. He was killed by militants – one of those whose hands Russia used to wage a hybrid war in Donbas and whom it is now using in the full-scale war., They detained Stepan when he was returning home. They saw a yellow and blue ribbon on his backpack – the colors of our flag. And that was reason enough for them to grab the boy. He was beaten for several days, tortured, and shot., Only in the middle of August of that year, weeks after the murder, Stepan's mother managed to find out what happened to her son. But she was not given his body., Only in November 2014 it was possible to bury him., Stepan's mother has the last text message from him: ""I'll call you later, I love you."", His killers hid in the territory of Russia and Crimea occupied by Russia. They received sentences from the Ukrainian court. But the terrorist state Russia protects them from being prosecuted., Them and thousands of other such murderers., Those who shot people simply because they were Ukrainians. Simply because they were Ukrainians in Ukraine., Those who shot men and women in the back of the head for the mere suspicion that the person was defending our state., Those who shot at residential buildings, at schools and hospitals point blank from tanks., Those who used artillery to bombard peaceful cities., It started back then – in 2014, and 175 days ago it reached the maximum scale that the Russian army, Russian mercenaries from the so-called military companies, which are de facto part of the secret services of the terrorist state, are capable of., Russia really wants to seize the territory of Ukraine. And it needs this territory without Ukrainians., The destroyed Mariupol and dozens of other cities and villages of Ukraine, the Bucha massacre and other cities in the occupied territory are not exceptions to the general Russian strategy, this is what it is – the Russian strategy towards Ukraine and Ukrainians., Tens of thousands of our people are kept for months in the so-called ""filtration camps"" set up by the Russian military., Thousands of Ukrainian children were deported from the territory entered by the Russian army. They are taken to Russia, and Russian officials are trying to do everything so that these children lose all contact with their families and simply forget who they are., Monuments and museums that simply remind of Ukraine are being destroyed on the occupied territory. They destroy books. They do everything so that people are forced to give up their national identity, their aspirations, dreams, and obey violence and robbery or die., Ukraine has already lost the lives of tens of thousands of its people in this war. Very small children – one-month-old babies, who were killed by Russian missiles, shells and bullets. Teenagers. Men and women. Elderly people., Russia does not care who to kill and who to abuse. Everyone is equally its target. And these are not excesses of war. This is its conscious policy., Therefore, we have no other choice but to fight for the lives of Ukrainians, so that in Ukraine they are not killed for a yellow-blue ribbon on a teenager's backpack. And this struggle can last only until victory., I can't count how many times before February 24 I suggested to Russia to end the war and negotiate peace. In different formats, through different mediation., It took many years to negotiate., But the leadership of Russia chose terror, not an agreement. They chose what they did in Mariupol, in Bucha, not peace. And when Moscow saw that the world would not turn a blind eye to Russian atrocities, they wanted to bring the whole world to its knees., That is why the food crisis has become so acute. That is why Russia is deliberately destabilizing the energy markets. That is why Russian policy is deepening the crisis of the cost of living in many countries for mercenary motives. And this is why we must jointly resist Russian aggression., When a state turns energy poverty or hunger into a weapon, it is a blow to everyone in the world. When a state tries to conquer another because it wants to be a colonizer, it is a threat to all who value their independence. And when people are killed simply because they are, because they belong to their people, because they do not give up their homeland, it is a threat to humanity as such., Can you stay away? Can you stay indifferent? I don't believe that., That is why you are here today, because you value the truth., And I'm not asking too much of you. I ask you to spread only the truth – spread the truth about this war in your country and in your region. It is necessary to oppose Russian propaganda., Demand full accountability for Russian murderers and executioners. Every war crime must receive its verdict by a competent and honest court., Support sanctions against Russia – because the aggressor must pay the highest price for aggression., And most importantly, value peace, value life, value your freedom and always, when you have such an opportunity, help defend peace, life and freedom by protecting those from whom they want to take it., I am very grateful to each of you, thank you for your attention!"
16 August 2022  - 22:09 ,"For us to expel the occupiers from Ukraine, every day must make it more and more difficult for Russia to wage a war - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Ukrainians!, Every day and every night we see new reports of explosions in the territory temporarily occupied by the occupiers. I am now asking all our people in Crimea, in other regions in the south of the country, in the occupied areas of Donbas, in the Kharkiv region to be very careful. Please do not approach the military objects of the Russian army and all those places where they store ammunition and equipment, where they keep their headquarters., The reasons for the explosions in the occupied territory can be different, very different, in particular, I quote the definition of the occupiers themselves, ""bungling""., But they all have the same meaning: the destruction of the occupiers' logistics, their ammunition, military and other equipment, command posts saves the lives of our people. The fewer opportunities the occupiers have to do evil and kill Ukrainians, the sooner we will be able to end this war by liberating our land. And the queue these days to leave Crimea for Russia across the bridge proves that the absolute majority of citizens of the terrorist state already understand or at least feel that Crimea is not a place for them., And I want to thank all Ukrainians who help our Armed Forces, our intelligence, our special services weaken the army of the occupiers. This is a significant advantage of Ukraine and the root cause of our future victory - the struggle of our defenders is based on the unconditional support of the Ukrainian people. This is a people's war of liberation, this is an all-Ukrainian struggle for freedom and independence for our country., Ukraine is protected by millions in one way or another. Millions of people who fight at the front, who fight for their cities and villages, including in the occupation, who stopped the occupiers' military equipment, who informed and inform our intelligence and special services, who oppose the occupiers in their rear, who ensure the necessary supplies for Ukraine and the work of all our state institutions and economy, who volunteer, who fight for our interests abroad, who fight in the information war., And we have to do - and will do - everything to preserve this nationwide foundation of defense., For the support of Ukraine in the world not to decrease and for our state to move towards victory, our own activity should not decrease either - the activity of absolutely everyone who in one way or another stood up for the defense of our state. Do everything, as you have been doing, for Ukraine. And even more, because the leadership of Russia expects that Ukrainians, Europeans and the whole world will get tired of this war. We must do everything so that it is not us or our friends and partners who get tired, but our enemy. For us to expel the occupiers from Ukraine, every day must make it more and more difficult for Russia to wage a war - this is our number one military-political task., I spoke today with President of France Emmanuel Macron. I informed him about the situation around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and regular Russian provocations. I thanked him for the great support. In particular, Mr. President and I have discussed new security and macro-financial assistance to our state., I also held talks with the Prime Minister of Denmark. Also about increasing financial support for Ukraine, about new sanctions against Russia. I thanked Mrs. Frederiksen for the defense assistance and for the fruitful conference in Copenhagen which recently agreed on concrete decisions for our defense., For the first time in the history of our bilateral relations, I held talks with the President of Zambia. Cooperation in international organizations, food security and current global threats were discussed., Ban Ki-moon, the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations, and Juan Manuel Santos, ex-President of Colombia, visited Ukraine today. The main topic of conversation with them is security guarantees for Ukraine., We are doing everything to form a military, political and legal security architecture for Ukraine, which will be real, effective and work in the long term, guaranteeing peace to our people., The Russian army continued its absolutely senseless and brutal shelling of the cities of the Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk regions - Orikhiv, Nikopol... Unfortunately, there are wounded, unfortunately, there are casualties. Shelling of Kharkiv and the border areas continues. But all this will not give anything to the occupiers and will not break our resistance., Our heroes repel constant and very powerful attacks in Donbas. The occupiers use everything there: aviation, missiles, phosphorus bombs, artillery... Very fierce battles are going on., We have to go through it, endure everything and gain life. Ukraine must win, and it will., Today I signed the decree on awarding our defenders. 189 warriors were awarded state awards. 158 are National Guard servicemen, 21 of them were awarded posthumously. 26 border guards, two of them posthumously. Three police officers, two of them posthumously. Two employees of the State Customs Service, one of them posthumously., Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine!, Eternal glory to all our heroes!, Glory to Ukraine!"
15 August 2022  - 22:52 ,Russian troops must be immediately withdrawn from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP without any conditions - address by the President of Ukraine,", Ukrainians!, And all Europeans whose lives are already endangered by Russian terror., Russia does not stop its blackmail in and around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Provocative shelling of the NPP territory continues. Under the cover of the plant, the occupiers are shelling nearby cities and communities. The Russian troops hide ammunition and equipment right in the facilities of the plant. De facto the plant is mined., All this clearly shows that Russia is rejecting the security demands of the European Union countries and 15 other countries - 42 in total - that called on Russia to withdraw its forces from the plant. In particular, these are Turkey, Georgia, Great Britain, Korea, Japan, Australia, Canada, the United States of America., If a terrorist state allows itself to completely ignore the demands of the international community, especially in such a sensitive topic, this clearly indicates the need for immediate action., Any radiation incident at the Zaporizhzhia NPP can affect the countries of the European Union, Turkey, Georgia and countries from more distant regions. Everything depends solely on the direction and speed of the wind. If Russia's actions cause a catastrophe, the consequences may also hit those who remain silent so far., This issue has already been brought to the highest international level - the UN and the IAEA. Of course, Russian nuclear blackmail is also discussed between states. There is a corresponding statement from the ministers of foreign affairs of the G7. They clearly understand that Russia is responsible for this nuclear crisis., But we need to move from discussions and calls to new tough sanctions against Russia, against Rosatom and the entire nuclear industry of the terrorist state. All Russian troops must be immediately withdrawn from the plant and neighboring areas without any conditions., The world has been fighting for many decades for proper control over all activities with nuclear materials and radiation safety. And if now the world lacks the strength and determination to protect one nuclear plant, it means that the world loses. Loses to terrorists. Gives in to nuclear blackmail. And this may be a precedent that other terrorists will see. There is still a chance to prevent this defeat., I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. The main item on the agenda is a thorough analysis of the military-strategic situation. Head of the Main Intelligence Directorate Budanov and Head of the Foreign Intelligence Service Lytvynenko delivered reports. A separate report was delivered by Commander of the Special Operations Forces Khorenko. Of course, there were Zaluzhny, Shaptala, Monastyrskyi, Danilov, Yermak, Reznikov., We also considered - from what can be said publicly - the issue of providing our military with weapons and ammunition and the status of implementation of the previous decisions of the Staff - all of them must be implemented 100%, the responsibility for this is personal., A rather productive meeting of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine took place today. Among other things, the deputies voted for two members of the High Council of Justice., I continue to establish relations at the highest level with African countries. Today I spoke with the President of Niger - until today there were no contacts at this level between our states. I thanked him for the support within the UN. Of course, the key threats to global security were discussed., I held a meeting on the preparation of the Crimea Platform. I expect the expansion of geography, level and number of participants. Today, the Advisory Council on the Deoccupation of Crimea was created to coordinate all measures and projects in this direction and ensure the activities of the Crimea Platform., I met with Andriy Shevchenko and actor Liev Schreiber, ambassadors of our state charity platform UNITED24. We discussed how we can maintain the maximum attention of the world to the needs of our defense. Each week, this task becomes increasingly important., Russia has created so many crises, including the crisis of the cost of living in many countries, as well as food and energy crises, that spread insecurity and irritation with life throughout the world. We must keep global attention focused on the root cause of these crises, namely: Russian aggression. And we have to remind that it was Ukraine that suffered the most from Russian terror., I am grateful to all who perform this important function, in particular the UNITED24 ambassadors. Their activity means billions of hryvnias for Ukraine and a constant increase in attention to the needs of our state and people., The situation on the frontline has not undergone significant changes over the past day. The heroic resistance of our military continues in Donbas, the Kharkiv region. We are putting pressure on the enemy in the south of our country., I would like to especially thank all our gunners, our intelligence officers, the Security Service of Ukraine and all others who ensure the successive destruction of the occupiers' command posts and their ammunition depots. All Russian terrorists should know that every meter of Ukrainian land is an absolute danger for them. No matter how they try to hide. No matter where it is. They will be found and destroyed., Eternal glory to all who fight for Ukraine!, Eternal gratitude to everyone who helps our state!, Glory to Ukraine!"
14 August 2022  - 22:11 ,"The stronger Ukraine will be, the weaker Russia will be and the less this war will last - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, We are getting ready for the very active weeks of the second half of August – negotiations, meetings, the Crimea Platform, new appeals to foreign communities, international legal activity – on our initiative., This week, I will continue to expand our ties with African states and the Latin American region. Important contacts will take place at the European level tomorrow. In a few days, a ceremony of the presentation of credentials by the ambassadors of foreign countries who came to work in Kyiv will take place. Although there is a certain pause in global politics now - after all, it is August, for Ukraine, for the interests of our state, there haven’t been and will not be any pauses., We are working on new sanctions against Russia and on stimulating the citizens of the terrorist state to feel their share of responsibility for what is happening., The discussion about visa restrictions in Europe for holders of Russian passports is expanding every day, new states and new politicians are joining it. Ultimately, this should lead to appropriate decisions., I am grateful to our intelligence officers, law enforcement officers, journalists and everyone who works to establish the full data on the Russian killers. Ukraine and our partners are receiving more and more information about those directly responsible for terror and torture, for the so-called filtration and deportation of our people, for looting..., All these savages will definitely be held to account., But we must remember that when evil takes on such proportions, people's silence approaches the level of complicity. And the rejection of the real fight against evil becomes the assistance to it. Therefore, if you have Russian citizenship and you are silent, it means that you are not fighting, it means that you are supporting it. And no matter where you are - both on the territory of Russia and abroad - your voice should sound in support of Ukraine, and therefore against this war., In the near future, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine will have to make a decision on the extension of martial law and general mobilization. An obvious decision, obvious reasons., Ukraine has always longed and longs for peace and many times in various negotiation formats has offered the Russian leadership to end the war and free Ukrainian land from occupation. But so far, Russia believes in terror, remains in the grip of its propaganda illusions and still hopes that it can supposedly achieve something through various forms of blackmail. It won’t., And therefore, we must defend ourselves, we must respond to every manifestation of terror, to all shelling occasions - brutal shelling that does not stop for a single day. Unfortunately, we have losses. But we must fight at all levels and on all fronts, strengthen our state as much as possible, preserve our unity and attract even more countries to our anti-war coalition., The stronger Ukraine will be, the weaker Russia will be, and therefore, the less time this war will last. And everyone in Ukraine, everyone in the free world must do everything in their power and everything possible so that Russia and those who support the war pay an ever greater price for Russian state terror., I am thankful to all our defenders!, I am thankful to all Ukrainians - all those who hold on, who help others, who believe in victory and bring it closer by their actions - as they can., Each new day should bring a new result for Ukraine., Glory to Ukraine!"
13 August 2022  - 21:56 ,We will do everything so that new sanctions against Russia block its nuclear industry – address of President of Ukraine,", Dear Ukrainians!, And today I would like to address the residents of Nikopol, Marhanets, Enerhodar, Kryvy Rih, Zaporizhzhia and all our other cities and communities of Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia regions., The occupiers are trying to intimidate people in an extremely cynical way, using the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. They actually hide behind the plant to fire at Nikopol and Marhanets. They arrange constant provocations with shelling of the territory of the nuclear power plant and try to bring their additional forces in this direction to blackmail our state and the entire free world even more., If someone over there in Russia thinks that it can give them something, then they are wrong. Russian blackmail only mobilizes even more global efforts to confront terror. Every day of the stay of the Russian contingent on the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP and in the neighboring regions of our country increases the radiation threat to Europe so much that even at the peak moments of the confrontation during the Cold War, this did not happen., Of course, there should be a robust response to this. Ukrainian diplomats and representatives of partner states will do everything to ensure that the new sanctions against Russia necessarily block the Russian nuclear industry., And absolutely all officials of the terrorist state, as well as those who help them in this blackmail operation with the nuclear power plant, must be tried by an international court. It will definitely be. And every Russian soldier who either shoots at the plant, or shoots under the cover of the plant, must understand that he is becoming a special target for our intelligence, for our secret service, for our army., I am especially grateful to everyone who defends this direction, who withstands the pressure of Russian terrorists and protects Ukraine and the world from the nuclear threat created by the occupiers. I am grateful to all our energy workers who support the stable operation of the energy system of Ukraine and the Zaporizhzhia plant itself., And we are doing everything possible to restore peace and security to this part of our state, and to all other cities and other regions of our beautiful Ukraine., Fierce fighting continues in Donbas. The hottest points of the front in this direction remain unchanged – Avdiyivka, Maryinka, Pisky, Bakhmut and the entire relevant area. Russia sent there a simply colossal amount of its military resources – artillery, equipment, people. All our defenders there are simply heroes., Ukrainian defense is strong in Kharkiv region, and the invaders' attempts to attack all the time fail., The struggle in the south of the country gives good news about the destruction of the forces and means of the Russian army. We do not lose a single day – we reduce the potential of the occupiers., It is very important that the export grain initiative gives results. Since the start of its implementation, a total of 16 vessels with grain for seven countries on three continents have left Ukrainian ports. These are Europe, Asia, Africa. Almost half a million tonnes of agricultural products were on board: corn, wheat, sunflower oil, soybeans and other goods absolutely necessary for the global market., This has already made it possible to reduce the severity of the food crisis, and has given some hope of peace to the countries that consume our agricultural products. And in the long run, it can help to completely remove the food crisis from the global agenda. Of course, if the partners ensure the implementation of the security part of the initiative and prevent Russian provocations and terror at sea or against our ports., The first vessel to be loaded within the framework of the UN World Food Program has already arrived. It is the supply of grain, in particular for Ethiopia, where the situation with hunger is particularly severe. Now the vessel is being prepared for departure from the Pivdenny port., For Ukraine, this has significant benefits. In less than two weeks, three of our ports – Odesa, Chornomorsk and Pivdenny – managed to export such a volume, which is equal to the entire agricultural export by road for July and more than two-thirds of the export by rail for the past month., I want to emphasize once again: these are jobs for our people, these are the funds needed for our sowing season next year, and these are the revenues of our state budget., Increasing economic activity is a necessary element of the path to victory., I am grateful to everyone who defends our country!, Grateful to everyone in the partner countries who help fight against terror!, Glory to Ukraine!"
12 August 2022  - 23:19 ,"Visa restrictions for Russian citizens fair, all defenders of European values should insist on them – address of President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, Today, for the first time, Ukraine celebrates the International Youth Day simultaneously with most of the world's countries. This decision was made last summer – to postpone its celebration to August 12 to be together with Europe in such a symbolic event. And it worked. Youth Day felt very organic today., And above all, together with the First Lady, we met with young heroes-saviors - you are great, I am proud of children and teenagers who are strong despite their age, responsible despite their age. They raise funds for the army, they help our wounded, they help people, they help save people's lives., A special awarding ceremony for such our young heroes was held in the Mariinsky Palace, in the White Hall of Heroes of Ukraine. Maksym Brovchenko, Irynka Vasylieva, Oleksandr Hutsal, Yehor Shemet, Davyd Ponuliak, Hlib Bondarenko, Andriy Pokrasa, Danylo Serheev. They are from seven to sixteen years old, and they are heroes. And one can be proud of their deeds in such a way that not every adult has such a biography., I also met today with representatives of various youth communities and organizations – educational, volunteer, military, creative, Plast, with representatives of youth from the diaspora... I am very proud that Maryna Viazovska, one of the most famous young Ukrainian women, who received the highest award in the world of mathematics – the famous Fields Medal, also attended the meeting., We had a very warm and fruitful conversation about the defense of our country, about victory – and it is on the horizon, about the future of Ukraine, about our institutions. The ideas sounded very good – we will implement them., I had a talk with the pontiff today. I thanked Pope Francis for the support of Ukrainians. We discussed what we can do together to restore peace in the state. I briefed him on the situation on the front line and Russia's constant efforts to increase the level of terror. He agrees with it, he supports us., The day before, a decision was made in Latvia – Latvia officially recognized Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. We are working to ensure that the whole world does the same. That's fair. It is right. And it will be., After all that the occupiers have done in Ukraine, there can be only one attitude towards Russia - as towards a terrorist state. And, by the way, it is from this point of view that the attitude towards the citizens of Russia should be determined., I thank the Czech Republic, the Baltic states and other countries that brought the issue of visas for citizens of a terrorist state to the official level of discussion in Europe. Of course, we all understand: there are people who really need protection, who are persecuted in Russia, may even be killed, and therefore they should receive help from the civilized world. These are well-known legal mechanisms – through refugee status, asylum requests, and other opportunities to help and support. But it is for those who fight, for those who are persecuted. And this should not apply to the rest of Russian citizens in Europe, tourism, entertainment, business affairs. It is impossible to work for a terrorist state..., First, there must be a guarantee that Russian murderers and facilitators of state terror will not use Schengen. And secondly, one cannot destroy the very idea of Europe, our common European values, that is, one cannot turn Europe into a supermarket where it does not matter who enters – the main thing is that a person simply pays for the goods., Therefore, visa restrictions for citizens of the Russian Federation are fair, and all defenders of European values should insist on them., In the evening, I signed a decree awarding our soldiers and heroes. A total of 181 combatants were given state awards, 33 of them posthumously. In total, more than 26,500 Ukrainian men and women were awarded during the war., I am grateful to everyone who defends our country! Who deters very brutal attacks of the occupiers in Pisky, in Avdiyivka, in the Bakhmut area... Who defends Kharkiv region and our south, our dear Ukraine., We will do everything so that each occupier, as well as the terrorist state in general, will fully feel what a strong Ukrainian response to their terror is., Glory to all our soldiers!, Glory to Ukraine!"
11 August 2022  - 22:52 ,Only the complete withdrawal of Russians from the Zaporizhzhia NPP guarantees the restoration of nuclear safety for the whole of Europe - address by the President of Ukraine,", Ukrainians!, Brief summaries of the day., I took part in the donor conference in Copenhagen. These are 26 partner states of Ukraine: European countries, the United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand. They established another format - as a continuation of the well-known meetings at the Ramstein Air Base. This format is about long-term support, including weapons, ammunition, military training, demining, recovery of the liberated territory., We already have the first results of the conference. Immediately after the opening of the meeting, Denmark announced a new support package for Ukraine in the amount of 110 million euros. In general, the conference collected 1.5 billion euros in just one day, which will be spent, in particular, on the production of vital ammunition. By the way, this is a significant plus to those credit guarantees for 4 billion dollars that were previously provided by the United States to strengthen our defense cooperation with partners on the supplies for the Ukrainian army., I am thankful to everyone who supported Ukraine today in Copenhagen, and I believe that this format of cooperation will accelerate our joint victory., In my address to the conference participants, I emphasized that everyone needs to act much faster and tougher. And especially after Russia resorted to unconcealed nuclear blackmail. What is happening now around the Zaporizhzhia NPP is one of the biggest crimes of the terrorist state. Today, another shelling by Russia was recorded on the territory of the plant, in the immediate vicinity of the NPP facilities., Russia has once again gone through another floor in the world history of terrorism. No one else has used a nuclear plant so obviously to threaten the whole world and to put forward some conditions. And absolutely everyone in the world should react immediately to expel the occupiers from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. This is a global interest, not just a Ukrainian need. We emphasize this at all levels - from the UN Security Council to contacts between states. Only the complete withdrawal of Russians from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP and the restoration of Ukraine's full control over the situation around the plant will guarantee the restoration of nuclear safety for all of Europe., Today I would like to point out an important thing for all representatives of the state and local authorities, the military sphere and other persons who comment on the events at the front, the defense plan of the command, the preparation of specific operations, etc. The general rule is simple: war is definitely not the time for vanity and loud statements. The less concrete details you give about our defense plans, the better it will be for the implementation of those defense plans., If you want to leave the big headlines, that's one thing. Frankly irresponsible. If you want victory for Ukraine, then that is another thing, and you should feel your responsibility for every word you say about our state’s preparation for defense or counteroffensive., Another conversation took place in the permanent format ""Yermak, Sullivan, Zaluzhny, Milley"". The topic of the conversation is clear. The content is positive. And the details, I think, are superfluous., I met today with chef Jose Andres, the founder of World Central Kitchen international humanitarian organization. For more than ten years, he has been feeding people in countries that have become victims of war or natural disasters. A successful restaurateur, working in America, one of the most famous and influential people in the world., From the first days of Russia's full-scale war against our country, his organization started working on the border with Poland - for migrants. Subsequently, it started activities in many cities of Ukraine - already 5 thousand people work there. More than 130 million meals have been cooked for our citizens., We agreed with Mr. Andres on the expansion of such a humanitarian mission, in particular to areas that are gradually being liberated from Russian occupation., And today I also want to thank all Ukrainians and citizens of the friendly states who help meet the humanitarian needs created by this war. Those who help displaced people with housing and jobs. Those who treat and rehabilitate those wounded by Russian shelling. Those who deliver medicine, food and means of communication to the frontline areas. Those who support lonely people and orphans of this war. And those who help restore everything that was destroyed by Russian terrorists., This is a multi-thousand-strong humanitarian army of Ukraine and the entire free world, to which Russia cannot and will not be able to oppose anything. I thank you!, Tomorrow will be a busy day - there will be many international and domestic events tomorrow. We are already preparing for them. We do everything to ensure that our defenders have reliable support at the political, diplomatic, economic, humanitarian and all other levels., Eternal glory to all our warriors!, Glory to each and every one who defends Donbas, the Kharkiv region, the south, the center and our entire state!, Glory to Ukraine!"
11 August 2022  - 14:08 ,"No one will be able to stop the wind carrying radiation, but all of us can stop the terrorist state of Russia - President's speech at the Conference of Defense Ministers of Northern European Countries and Ukraine",", Dear Prime Minister Frederiksen!, Dear Minister Bødskov!, Dear attendees, dear participants of the Conference!, I am grateful for the organization of such an important event, which is urgently needed now - and not only for Ukraine., To begin with, I would like to remind you of one episode of our shared history. It happened in Sweden. About 700 kilometers from Copenhagen, just over an hour by plane. One day at the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant, radiation monitoring devices showed the presence of radiation contamination. Then everything was quickly checked and no sources of radiation were found in Forsmark., However, reports began to arrive from other sites in Sweden, as well as from Finland, that there was also an increased level of radiation. Concerns were also raised in Denmark - an increase in the level of radioactive substances was also recorded there., It became clear that an emergency had occurred, but at that time they did not know exactly where. They analyzed the nature of the pollution, the direction and velocity of the wind - and found out that somewhere in the territory from Minsk to the Black Sea, a disaster occurred., It was April 1986 - a day after the explosion of the nuclear reactor in Chornobyl. The Soviet authorities were silent about what happened at that time. And tried to downplay the scale of the disaster. However, it was impossible to hide it - there has already been publicity in Europe, there has already been evidence of pollution, and a discussion has already begun about how it threatens all people., I will not remind you now of all the details of those days. You all probably know about it. About the fire at the Chornobyl station and the efforts of those who tried to stop the unfolding of the disaster. About the diagnosis of ""acute radiation syndrome"" and about people who begged for salvation in terrible death agonies., Significant areas were contaminated. There is still an Exclusion Zone around Chornobyl, where people are not allowed to live. Hundreds of thousands of residents of different countries were affected by Chornobyl in one way or another., And for years after that disaster, the whole world has been thinking about how to make nuclear energy secure. For years, adherence to special standards has been monitored to ensure that such disasters do not occur., And for years absolutely no one could imagine that Europe could be threatened with a new disaster at a nuclear plant not because someone would violate some safety standards, but because some state would deliberately use a nuclear plant for terror., This is what Russia is doing now. And if the Soviet authorities tried to conceal the Chornobyl disaster and its full consequences, the Russian authorities are much more cynical and dangerous - they themselves do everything to maximize the risk of a nuclear disaster, and lie to the whole world that someone else is allegedly to blame., We must protect Europe from this threat. Protect all together. And probably not only Europe. Because the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine is the largest on our continent. It is the third largest in the world. Six power units!, During the years of operation of this station, there was not a single incident that would endanger the safety of Ukrainians or all Europeans. But now the Russian occupation army is using the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant for terror and armed provocations., Russia has turned the nuclear plant into a battlefield. When the occupiers came to the Zaporizhzhia NPP, their tanks fired at it. Direct fire at the plant! Placing military equipment on the territory of the plant and even disposing of ammunition there, the Russian troops surely know that they are putting the whole of Europe at risk of a nuclear disaster., And of course, the Russian authorities are aware of the possible consequences when their troops fire at a nuclear plant. In particular, from MLRS., In August, it was already now, they damaged the plant's communication lines with our power system, as well as radiation monitoring sensors, nitrogen-oxygen station, hydrogen pipelines and related infrastructure. Already then, Europe was a few steps away from a nuclear disaster. And now we are all in this difficult situation., We are convinced that it is not a coincidence that the trajectory of the cruise missiles which Russia fires at the territory of Ukraine passes over the Ukrainian nuclear power plants. All these are manifestations of Russian nuclear terrorism., Russia has become a terrorist state, and is actually holding nuclear plants hostage, and is blackmailing everyone with a probable disaster., I am sure each of you has already thought about how to act if Russia uses so-called tactical nuclear weapons. Think about this as well. Russia can cause the largest radiation accident in history at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. In terms of actual consequences, it could be even more catastrophic than Chornobyl, and in fact - the same as the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, but without a nuclear strike., None of us can stop the wind if it carries radiation. But together we are capable of stopping a terrorist state. And the sooner we stop Russia, the sooner Europe and the world will be able to feel safe again., Everything that is necessary for this is well known to you., Sanctions against Russia must be strengthened and not allowed to be circumvented. In response to nuclear blackmail, tough sanctions are needed against Rosatom, this is a specific thing, and the entire Russian nuclear industry, not an agreement with them., Constant political pressure on Russia is needed to increase the number of countries participating in the anti-war coalition, and to reduce the circle of those who are at least somehow willing to help Russia in these circumstances., And most importantly, we need even greater support for Ukraine with weapons and ammunition. To really stop Russia, the Armed Forces of Ukraine must have as many shells as necessary to make it tangible that Russia is not able to put pressure on the battlefield. And Ukraine needs weapons of such power, such a long range that Russia is forced to finally think about finding a peaceful solution., Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov who is present among you at the Conference will definitely inform you about specific defense needs., The second point is finances. Russia still receives tens of billions of dollars due to trade with other countries, and Europe in particular., And in Ukraine, the monthly deficit of the state budget alone is about five billion dollars., And the destruction caused by the war is happening on the territory of Ukraine. And we cannot wait until the war is over to restore normal life., Our children have to go to school just like yours. Our youth, just like yours, have to study at universities. Hospitals and social infrastructure have to work in Ukraine just like yours. Therefore, Ukraine needs reconstruction. Now! Just now! And even more so on the eve of the winter season., We need to carry out demining. And, of course, we need to prepare the defense for winter conditions., Therefore, sufficient and timely financial support for our state, for the budget and for the Fast Recovery is as vital as weapons and ammunition for our army, and sanctions against Russia., And the state that blocks this financing for Ukraine cannot have excuses. It should remember that it is a European country and should fix this problem immediately., And the third point is the export to Russia, the supply of components and dual-use products to the companies of the terrorist state. Russia simply would not have a combat-ready army in modern conditions if it was not for imported parts. Electronics, optics and many other parts of foreign production are used in manufacturing missiles, drones, means of communication, armored vehicles, etc. This flow of technical assistance to Russian terror must be completely stopped!, There must be an effective mechanism to control any supply to Russia, so as not to miss a single detail that could go to the production of weapons for shelling peaceful cities or nuclear plants., Ladies and Gentlemen!, The response now needs to be full-scale, just like the war that Russia started., No one needs new disasters., It is necessary to draw conclusions from the disaster of 1986. From the decades that Russia used to prepare for this vile war against all of free Europe. From eight years of war in Donbas. And from one hundred and seventy days of terror against Ukraine after February 24., No silence - only the truth. No delay - only decisive action. No confusion - only confident, bold unity., We need maximum weapons and ammunition for our defense. Finances are needed for Ukraine in sufficient volume and without any bureaucratic blockages., Complete isolation of the terrorist state, primarily economic, technological, and the toughest sanctions are required., It is our duty to our nations, to all future generations of free people, to do everything we can to stop Russia, to ensure that it loses this war and that no other state can repeat this terror., And I believe that we will fulfill our duty!, Thank you for your attention!, I am grateful to Denmark and Great Britain for jointly organizing this Conference, which could become historic. Due to our joint efforts., Thank you again!, Glory to Ukraine!"
10 August 2022  - 22:34 ,"The more losses the occupiers suffer, the sooner we will be able to liberate our land - address by the President of Ukraine",", Ukrainians!, All our defenders!, At the end of this difficult 168th day of our defense, a few things should be said., First. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence and our law enforcement agencies will not leave today's Russian shelling of the Dnipropetrovsk region unanswered. 13 people died as a result of the occupiers' attack on Marhanets'. More than ten are wounded, five are in grave condition., Russian troops were striking with ""Grads"". This regular manifestation of Russian terror, just as the attacks on Mykolaiv and Kharkiv, once again proves that it is necessary to increase military aid to Ukraine. The more powerful our weapons are and the greater the range of their use is, the sooner this cruel war will end., And that's the second thing I wanted to say today. This is a question that worries absolutely everyone: when will the war end? Someone says - months, someone - a year, someone - even more. But the question of time actually directly depends on the question of the losses that Russia will suffer. The more losses the occupiers suffer, the sooner we will be able to liberate our land and guarantee Ukraine's security. This is what everyone who defends our state and helps Ukraine should think about: how to inflict the greatest possible losses on the occupiers so that the time of the war gets shorter., If almost 43,000 dead Russian soldiers do not convince the Russian leadership that they need to find a way out of the war, then more fighting is needed, more results are needed to convince., In just one day, the occupiers lost ten combat aircraft: nine in Crimea and one more in the direction of Zaporizhzhia. The occupiers also suffer new losses of armored vehicles, warehouses with ammunition, logistics routes..., A conference at the level of defense ministers of Ukraine's partner states begins tomorrow in Copenhagen. Further support for our state in this war, including weapons, will be discussed. I am grateful to all our partners who understand that only by ensuring Russia's defeat on the battlefield, only by Russian losses - military, political, economic - can the return of security for Ukraine and the whole of Europe be brought closer. The more weapons, the more military-technical and financial support Ukraine receives, the sooner our people and all Europeans will be able to experience peace and stability in life again., And the third thing. I want to say it right now to the residents of the temporarily occupied territory. No matter what the occupiers promise, their only way is to escape. At best. If they make it in time., We expelled the Russian army from the northern regions. We expelled the invaders from our Zmiinyi Island. They already feel that the time has come to flee from Kherson and from the south of our country in general. The time will come when they will flee from the Kharkiv region, from Donbas, from Crimea... And everyone who can help in this, should do so., If you have any important information about the enemy, please report it in a safe way to our intelligence services, our military. If you know those who help the occupiers or justify aggression, please report this as well., Be sure to help our people in the occupied territory who are left alone or without communication. Talk to them, support them, tell them about our struggle and about the possibilities of evacuating to a free territory. The invaders are using our people to cover their attacks as human shields. Ukraine will return everything of its own, and must save as many lives as possible., I held several important meetings today, in particular, regarding the program for the fast recovery of liberated territories., I continue to establish new ties at the highest level with African countries - today I spoke with the President of the Republic of Ghana. Yesterday - with the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Food security, cooperation in international organizations, economic ties are a range of issues that benefit both our state and African countries., In the evening, I signed another decree awarding our defenders. 244 combatants were awarded state awards, 21 of them posthumously., Ukrainians should always remember that every step of our army in this war was made in cruel and difficult battles. The occupiers have not captured anything without the resistance of our heroes since February 24 and will not be able to keep anything. We will liberate everything., Eternal glory to everyone who fights for our country!, Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
9 August 2022  - 23:11 ,Russian war against Ukraine and the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with it - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today, there is a lot of attention to the topic of Crimea. And rightly so. Because Crimea is Ukrainian, and we will never give it up., We will not forget that the Russian war against Ukraine began with the occupation of Crimea., Russia has turned our peninsula, which has always been and will be one of the best places in Europe, into one of the most dangerous places in Europe. Russia brought large-scale repression, environmental problems, economic hopelessness and war to Crimea. War., Perhaps historians will one day determine how many people were killed as a result of Russia's use of Crimea for terror. Tens of thousands? Hundreds of thousands? From Ukraine and Georgia to Syria and more remote regions., The presence of Russian occupiers in Crimea is a threat to the entire Europe and to global stability. The Black Sea region cannot be safe as long as Crimea is occupied. There will be no stable and lasting peace in many countries on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea as long as Russia is able to use our peninsula as its military base., This Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea - with its liberation. Today it is impossible to say when this will happen. But we are constantly adding the necessary components to the formula of liberation of Crimea., We launched the Crimea Platform - a key diplomatic platform for the work on the liberation of Crimea. The Crimea Platform will work this year as well. We are already preparing for this summit., The Crimean topic sounds on all international platforms where the Russian war against our state is discussed. The history of the global response to Russia's seizure of Crimea, or rather the lack of such a response, is now one of the best arguments for strengthening sanctions against Russia. The world is beginning to recognize that it made a mistake in 2014 when it decided not to respond with full force to Russia's first aggressive steps., And, of course, we pay due attention to the struggle for rights and historical justice for the indigenous peoples of Ukraine - the Crimean Tatar people, Karaites and Krymchaks. Today, on the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples, we really have something to say., Last summer, the fundamental law on indigenous peoples of Ukraine was adopted. This law recognizes the rights of indigenous peoples and representative bodies of indigenous peoples., Ukraine is a multinational state. Various national communities have been living on our land for centuries. But most of them have experience of state formation outside of Ukraine. Our state is native to peoples whose national cultures and aspirations were formed in Crimea. Therefore, when we are working for the liberation of the peninsula, we are fighting for the restoration of the territorial integrity of our state and for the return of home to the indigenous peoples of Ukraine. I believe that it will be so. I know that we will return to the Ukrainian Crimea. And I am grateful to all our partners and international organizations that help us in this., It is too early to disclose all the details, but this year the work of the Crimea Platform will be no less important and representative than last year, when its first summit was held in Kyiv. The format will be different, but the value will be even greater., We are preparing new solutions for the protection and assistance in the realization of the rights of the indigenous peoples of Ukraine. We are also preparing programs for the economic recovery of our Crimea after its liberation from the occupiers., Well, the main thing is to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence and everyone who is fighting to liberate our land and repel the Russian colonial invasion., From the Kharkiv region to Kherson, from Donetsk to Enerhodar, from Stanytsia Luhanska to Yalta, from Berdyansk to Novofedorivka - these are all parts of our country, this is Ukraine, which will be completely free., Today I signed a new decree on awarding our defenders. 182 combatants were awarded state awards. The total number of awarded Ukrainian warriors has already exceeded 26,000 since February 24., I thank everyone who defends Ukraine!, Eternal glory to all who fight for freedom!, Glory to Ukraine!"
8 August 2022  - 22:57 ,"After this Russian war against Ukraine, neither smoldering nor frozen conflict should remain - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Ukrainians!, These days, people remember the Russian war against Georgia in 2008. There are many talks about the prerequisites of that war, about its consequences. About how that year's refusal to provide Ukraine and Georgia with a NATO Membership Action Plan increased the audacity of the Russian leadership. But still, the war of that time has not yet become history, has not completely receded into the past. Therefore, it is necessary to talk more about what can be done than about what happened., The challenges of that time are still very relevant today. And not only because the threat of further Russian aggression in this part of the Caucasus still exists, even though it is frozen. Only now has the world begun to realize the need for real, effective tools to prevent such aggressions and to bring any aggressors to justice., 2008, 2014, 2022 - the wars that started in these years have a different scale and nature, but there is one meaning of what happened: regional and global security mechanisms did not work., That is why the principle of prevention, which we have been insisting on for a very long time even before February 24, is so necessary in international relations. If it is already clear that a state is preparing aggression - unjust, unprovoked, illegal, then the world's reaction to its preparation should be the same as to the aggression that happened. It is necessary to act to prevent war, not to wait for strikes and victims., After this Russian war against Ukraine, neither smoldering nor frozen conflict should remain. This is an important conclusion. Ukraine must return everything that Russia temporarily seized, and the aggressor state must be punished for the crime of aggression. And this is important not only for justice., Only the obvious defeat of the aggressor, their loss of everything captured and their international legal responsibility for aggression are safeguards against any war., This is what our diplomats, the Office, government officials and absolutely everyone involved in organizing a global political, economic and legal response to Russian aggression are working on. By protecting our state, we automatically protect everyone who has already been threatened or may still be threatened by a terrorist state., And, of course, the greatest contribution is now made by the military - all Ukrainian heroes who are breaking the Russian terrorist machine on the battlefield., Today I especially want to thank the Ukrainian anti-aircraft fighters of the Air Command ""Center"" and Air Command ""South"" for the successful destruction of Russian missiles that were launched from the Black Sea in the morning. The four downed Kalibrs are dozens of Ukrainian lives saved. Our military also managed to shoot down some of the missiles that Russian terrorists launched at Ukraine in the afternoon and in the evening., Yes, our military means are still not enough to guarantee the downing of all Russian missiles. And we will do everything to ensure that such means appear in our country. But even now, the skill of our heroes makes it possible, at least partially, to reduce the Russian terrorist threat. I am grateful to everyone who ensures that!, We are actively informing the world about Russian nuclear blackmail - about shelling and mining of the Zaporizhzhia NPP facilities. There are already appropriate reactions from the international community. But it is necessary to speed up actions in response. Russia will not pay attention to words and concerns. New sanctions are needed against the terrorist state and the entire Russian nuclear industry for creating the threat of a nuclear disaster. The world should not forget about Chornobyl and remember that the Zaporizhzhia NPP is the largest in Europe. The Chornobyl disaster is an explosion in one reactor, the Zaporizhzhia NPP is six power units., I held negotiations with the President of Botswana - the first in the history of our bilateral relations. We discussed cooperation within the UN and other international organizations. I expressed gratitude for the condemnation of Russian aggression and assured Mr. President that Ukraine is ready to continue being the guarantor of world food security., Implementation of the grain export initiative continues - today, for the first time since February 24, a loaded ship left the Pivdennyi port. Currently, there is every chance to ensure the rhythmic nature of such exports. However, as in previous days, the key thing is the ability of the partners to prevent any attempts by Russia to disrupt exports and exacerbate the global food crisis again., And I want to remind all our agrarians, all workers of our ports, all those involved in related industries and all those who comment on this that sea export was restored primarily thanks to our warriors who protected the relevant water area: our intelligence, our special operations forces and ""Alpha"" of the Security Service of Ukraine, gunners, the Navy, the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, border guards and our entire heroic army that defends the state., A new package of American support for Ukraine in the amount of one billion dollars was announced today. These are, in particular, rockets for HIMARS, ammunition for artillery and many other really useful things. I am grateful to President Biden and the people of the United States for this support, 100% of which is used to protect freedom, our common freedom., I signed a new decree on awarding combatants. 183 of our defenders were awarded state awards, four of them posthumously., Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine!, Gratitude to everyone who fights for the country!, Glory to Ukraine!"
7 August 2022  - 21:07 ,A principled response from the international community to the Russian strikes at the Zaporizhzhia NPP is needed right now - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today is the Day of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and now I want to once again congratulate all military pilots and also all defenders of our skies on a professional holiday., We are all proud of you and wish you so many victories that the Russian soldiers are simply afraid of even the very thought of our Ukrainian sky., This morning, I congratulated the fighters and commanders of the Air Force, handed out state awards to the best warriors., I handed over the ""Golden Star"" orders to the wives of the fallen Heroes of Ukraine - Lieutenant colonel Eduard Vahorovsky and Major Dmytro Kolomiyets. They gave their lives saving their brothers and protecting our state. Eternal memory and gratitude to the Heroes!, I spoke today with President of the European Council Charles Michel. I informed him about the situation on the battlefield, about the threat that Russia created by striking at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. There is no such nation in the world that can feel safe when a terrorist state fires at a nuclear plant. God forbid, if something irreparable happens, no one will stop the wind that will spread the radioactive contamination. Therefore, a principled response of the international community to these Russian attacks on the Zaporizhzhia NPP - the largest in Europe - is needed right now., The situation in Donbas remains very difficult. Our army is doing everything possible to stop the Russian terror and inflict the greatest possible losses on the occupiers. Avdiivka, Pisky, Maryinka, Bakhmut and other hot areas in the Donetsk region take the main efforts and, unfortunately, many lives., It is also difficult in the Kharkiv region, in the south of our country, where the occupiers are trying to concentrate their forces., The key thing now, just as before, is weapons for our defense, weapons from partners. Every day without any pauses, we work to increase the supply of weapons, to send more powerful and long-range systems to the front., And next week we expect news from partners regarding support packages. Good news., In this summer time, every week there are more and more reports that the occupiers are preparing for pseudo-referendums in the occupied areas of the south of our country. I want to say a very simple thing: everyone who helps the occupiers in any way realize their intention will be held accountable. They will bear responsibility to Ukraine., The position of our state remains the same: we will not give up anything of ours, and if the occupiers follow the path of these pseudo-referendums, they will close for themselves any possibility of negotiations with Ukraine and the free world, which the Russian side will definitely need in a certain moment., Next week, I will continue the practice of political appeals to representatives of partner states and nations who defend freedom together with us. A number of important negotiations are also planned - and not only with current politicians., As before, Ukraine will do everything to make our struggle and Ukrainian needs known in all countries of the world and in all audiences - even those who usually do not follow political life., In particular, American actress Jessica Chastain arrived in Kyiv today. She visited ""Okhmatdyt"" and saw with her own eyes the consequences of the Russian occupation in Irpin, Kyiv region., Her story about our war will definitely be heard. We are preparing an important humanitarian event., And I am grateful to all friends of Ukraine abroad and to everyone who helps expand our ties in the world., We are doing everything to win, everything to protect our country., I wish all of us Ukrainians a fruitful new week!, Glory to our warriors!, Glory to Ukraine!"
6 August 2022  - 22:47 ,We are doing everything to get yet more effective and modern weapons – address of President of Ukraine,", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, I will brief you on the past week., First of all, I want to thank all our soldiers, who are extremely bravely - and in the hottest points of the frontline, with simply superhuman efforts – holding back the enemy., The Russian army will not change its tactics. The occupiers know that they will lose to the Ukrainians in direct struggle, they are inferior in skill, and that is why the enemy is counting on artillery and indiscriminate shelling., They try to destroy everything in front of them and enter the ruins. And I am grateful to everyone who, even in such conditions, still is containing the occupiers in Donbas, in Kharkiv region, in the Mykolaiv direction – wherever the confrontation is the most acute., During this week, the Armed Forces of Ukraine and our intelligence have achieved powerful results in destroying the logistics of the Russian army, the rear bases of the occupiers. And every strike on the enemy's ammunition depots, on their command posts, on accumulations of Russian equipment saves the lives of all of us, the lives of Ukrainian military and civilians., Of course, I thank the partners – everyone who supplies Ukraine with the necessary weapons. In particular, another package of support from the United States was approved this week, which also includes ammunition for the HIMARS systems. Thank you very much. All of them are used as accurately and beneficially as possible for the overall strategy of our defense. We are doing everything to get yet more effective and modern weapons., It was possible to restore the sea export of Ukrainian agricultural products. Our ports on the Black Sea are operating again. And although it is still too early to give general assessments of the process, we can still say that it is positive both for our state and for all our partners., However, the key security risk has not yet been removed. The threat of Russian provocations and terrorist attacks remains. Everyone should be aware of this., But if the partners fulfill their part of the commitment and guarantee the security of the supply, it will really solve the global food crisis., And we must not forget that the restoration of our sea exports was made possible primarily thanks to our soldiers – all those who defend Odesa and secured the liberation of Snake Island. These are simply heroes., During the week, opportunities for Ukraine in the African direction were significantly expanded. There were new contacts with state leaders and communication with journalists. I will continue this work next week – another series of negotiations is planned., Unfortunately, we have a significant worsening of the situation around the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Russian terrorists became the first in the world to use a nuclear plant for terror. The biggest in Europe! We will draw the world's attention to this and insist on new sanctions against Russia for creating such a global threat., And despite the fact that the Russian shelling of the nuclear plant is one of the most dangerous crimes against Ukrainians and all Europeans, against the right to life of every person, for some reason there is no report or even a simple notification from Amnesty International about it. A very eloquent silence, which once again indicates the manipulative selectivity of this organization., This week there are new sanction steps from Canada and the United States. Switzerland made an important decision regarding support for the seventh EU sanctions package. The general tendency to strengthen sanctions remains unchanged and will continue increasing the price for this terror, terror against our people, for the terrorist state., I want to thank everyone who develops our UNITED24 public charity platform, and all the ambassadors of this platform – Andriy Shevchenko, Elina Svitolinia, Liev Schreiber, the band Imagine Dragons, Demna. This week we summed up the three-month results of work the UNITED24 platform. More than UAH 6 billion were raised in contributions for reconstruction, equipment for hospitals, for the purchase of ambulances – dozens of ambulances were purchased. There is already the first helicopter bought using the funds raised by UNITED24. It will be used to rescue the wounded. It was possible to attract help from more than a hundred countries., One of the most important areas for August and September is the implementation of our Fast Recovery Plan. What needs to be done in the territory liberated from the enemy to give people conditions for a normal life and to prepare for the autumn and winter season. In total, 1,060 settlements have already been liberated, and the absolute majority of them require significant restoration work, demining, and the construction of social facilities. And I thank all our partners who joined the relevant work., In particular, this week the delegation of Estonia visited the districts of Zhytomyr region, which the country is helping with recovery. Estonia was the first within the Fast Recovery Plan to choose objects for financing., We work with diplomats and companies in all other areas that need support and restoration., We believe in our defenders! We help the defense!, Let's remain united and do everything for the victory of Ukraine! It will be!, Eternal glory to our soldiers!, Glory to Ukraine!"
5 August 2022  - 22:43 ,"The more our grain will be on the global market, the smaller will be the harvest of political chaos – address of President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians!, Three vessels with grain for export left our ports today – from Odesa and Chornomorsk. Almost 60,000 tonnes of corn are on board, which are expected by consumers in Turkey, the UK, and Ireland., The first new vessel since February 24 is heading to the port of Chornomorsk for loading., The main thing now is the constant increase in exports. Every adequate world player is interested in this. The more our grain will be on the global market, the smaller will be the harvest of political chaos in countries, primarily in Africa and Asia, but not only there. We must remember that this year the demand for imported food in Europe is much higher than expected. European harvests are smaller because of the heat. But the Ukrainian harvest of grain and oilseeds will most likely meet the forecasts – more than 65 million tonnes are expected. Therefore, if the partners do their part of the obligations under the Grain Initiative, the security part, and do not allow new Russian provocations in relation to our exports, then the food crisis, which has been so threatening to the world, can be overcome., But the situation on the energy market, and especially for European consumers, continues to be very dangerous due to Russia's cynical and worked out well gas blackmail. Instead of supplying gas to the territory of Europe in accordance with the contracts, Russia even simply burns it – and this is happening more than one week. Why does it do this? So that prices in Europe rise even more, so that ordinary Europeans suffer even more and so that it will be even more difficult for everyone on the continent to prepare for winter. This is a manifestation of Russia's deliberate anti-European policy, anti-human policy and the effect of the old mistakes of Europeans who did not want to see that Gazprom, Russian gas pipelines bypassing Ukraine are the same weapons for Russia as tanks and artillery, and each of us, each in Europe is a target for them., And we all have to defend ourselves now. Together to prepare for the new heating season. Together to respond to any provocations of Russia in the energy sector. Together to develop sanctions in response to Russian blackmail and terror., Today, the occupiers created another extremely risky situation for everyone in Europe – they fired at the Zaporizhzhia NPP, twice in one day. This is the largest nuclear power plant on our continent. And any shelling of this facility is an open, brazen crime, an act of terror. Russia should bear responsibility for the very fact of creating a threat to the nuclear power plant. And this is not only another argument in favor of recognizing Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. This is an argument in favor of applying tough sanctions against the entire Russian nuclear industry – from Rosatom to all related companies and individuals. This is purely a matter of safety. The one who creates nuclear threats to other nations is definitely not capable of using nuclear technologies safely., Today I held a meeting devoted to the sanctions policy, confiscation of Russian assets. As government officials reported, assets worth UAH 28 billion have already been forcibly seized in Ukraine. This work continues. More than 900 facilities belonging to the Russian state are proposed to be confiscated. And if we evaluate the property package not only of the terrorist state, but also of its residents, then this are 36,000 items for seizure. All this will be sent to compensate for the damages that Russia causes through war and terror., I also heard the results of the work of the group on the development and implementation of the international compensation mechanism and confiscation of Russian assets abroad. All our partners are actively working on this – in Europe, in the United States. Work on bills that will expand the possibilities for the confiscation of Russian assets for Ukraine is underway., And Donbas burned out by Russian strikes, the abuse of the occupiers over Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, the shelling of Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk region, Sumy region, Chernihiv region, Kyiv region, Zhytomyr region, Odesa region and other regions of Ukraine are what Russia will surely pay for: both politically and financially, and with its own future, which Russia is losing with every strike on our territory., I spoke today with the President of Malawi. It is another African state, the ninth country, which Ukraine is in contact with for the first time at the highest level in the entire history of our independence. I assured Mr. President that Ukraine will make every effort so that every country interested in our agricultural products can meet its consumption needs. We also discussed other issues of stability and our cooperation in international organizations., I also signed a decree awarding our soldiers. A total of 192 combatants were given state awards, 18 of them, unfortunately, posthumously., Eternal gratitude to all who is fighting for our great state!, Thank you, great people of Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
4 August 2022  - 22:38 ,There can be no condition under which any Russian attack on Ukraine becomes justified - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Ukrainians!, Today, Russian terrorists once again fired at Toretsk, Donetsk region, hitting public transport stop. Eight people died, three children are among those injured. Residential buildings were damaged by projectile fragments and the blast wave - those are ordinary high-rise buildings. St. Panteleimon Church was also damaged, the priest was wounded., It was a deliberate strike by the occupiers, another act of terror – cynical and calculated. They knew where they were hitting, and they obviously wanted people to get hurt., However, we do not see clear and timely reports from some international organizations regarding this and thousands of other crimes committed by Russian terrorists. We saw today a completely different report from Amnesty International, which unfortunately tries to amnesty the terrorist state and shift the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim., There cannot be - even hypothetically - any condition under which any Russian attack on Ukraine becomes justified. Aggression against our state is unprovoked, invasive and openly terroristic. And if someone makes a report in which the victim and the aggressor are allegedly the same in something, if some data about the victim is analyzed and what the aggressor was doing at that time is ignored, this cannot be tolerated., Almost 200 religious buildings alone - temples and prayer houses of various denominations - were damaged or destroyed by Russian strikes. Almost 900 medical facilities. Over 2,200 educational institutions. Dozens of universities, hundreds of schools and kindergartens. The occupiers repeatedly deliberately fired artillery and mortars at people queuing for water, at evacuation buses, and repeatedly at public transport stops. The Russian army did not even refrain from striking at the memorials to the victims of the Holocaust, at the cemeteries... At the camp with prisoners of war in Olenivka. And there are no reports about it for some reason. This is immoral selectivity., Anyone who amnesties Russia and who artificially creates such an informational context that some attacks by terrorists are supposedly justified or supposedly understandable, cannot but realize that it helps the terrorists. And if you provide manipulative reports, then you share the responsibility for the death of people with them., Every day we expand the possibilities of our foreign policy - formal and informal. I spoke today with representatives of the African media - from Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya and Ghana. African countries can be affected very seriously by the destabilization of world markets and global relations provoked by Russia, in particular due to the food crisis. At the same time, in Africa there is a shortage of true information about the Russian war against our country and a surplus of Russian propaganda. We’ll do everything to change this balance., Negotiations with the President of Guinea-Bissau took place for the first time in the history of our bilateral relations. I noted that Ukraine is ready to be a guarantor of food security for African countries. We discussed the support for our state in international organizations., Tomorrow there will be new negotiations with a leader of an African country, and in general, only recently we started proper communication with eight leaders of African states., Every day and in various ways, I remind some leaders of the European Union that Ukrainian pensioners, our displaced persons, our teachers and other people who depend on budget payments cannot be held hostage to their indecision or bureaucracy. 8 billion euros for Ukraine are currently suspended. And such an artificial delay of macro-financial assistance to our state is either a crime or a mistake, and it is difficult to say which is worse in such conditions of a full-scale war., I don't want to name the European country that is slowing it down now. Let's believe that this is still a mistake and that it will be corrected., I held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief today. Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov reported on the current provision of troops with equipment and ammunition. Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny, Head of the Security Service Malyuk, Minister of Internal Affairs Monastyrskyi also delivered reports. We analyzed the situation in the most acute areas of the frontline, in particular in the Donetsk region. Particular attention was paid to the state of implementation of the previous decisions of the Staff, all of them must be implemented by 100%., I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 192 combatants were awarded state awards, six of them posthumously. In total, more than 25,500 of our defenders have already been awarded for bravery and effectiveness in battles since February 24. More than 4 thousand - posthumously., Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine!, Eternal gratitude to everyone who fights against Russian terrorists!, Glory to Ukraine!"
3 August 2022  - 22:43 ,"The fragility of freedom can be protected only by joint actions, there must be an effective architecture of global security - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, These days, in our information space and in social networks, there are a lot of reports about conflict situations and threats that exist in other geographies. First - the Balkans, then - Taiwan, now it may be the Caucasus... All these situations seem different, although they are united by one factor, namely: the global security architecture did not work. If it worked, there wouldn't be all these conflicts., And this is actually what Ukraine has been drawing attention to not only for 161 days since the start of the full-scale war, but for years. Since Russia has completely ignored international law, the interests of humanity as such., 2014 became a turning point. Then, in quite obvious situations - with Crimea, with Donbas, with the downed Malaysian Boeing - Russia avoided immediate and tangible responsibility, preserved business and political ties with the world... And now many in global relations believe that they will manage to do so as well., That is why Ukrainians are now doing a very important thing for everyone in the world. Our people united the free world not just around their struggle for freedom, but around understanding how fragile our freedom is. The freedom of every nation in Europe and in other parts of the world., This fragility can only be protected by joint action, and for this to work in the long term, there must be an effective global security architecture that ensures that no state can ever again resort to terror against another state., At the system level, at the level of global institutions, this is exactly what we are currently working for - both the Ukrainian state and all our partners., Today I spoke with the student community of Australia. More than 20 universities, as well as the interest of Australia's leading media, politicians. I called on all our Australian friends to help us in the information war and spread the truth about Ukrainian defense and Russian terror as much as possible., It is necessary to solve an extremely important national task: the Ukrainian point of view should be seen and heard in those parts of the world where Russian propaganda is still very loud. This applies to the Pacific region, the countries of South and East Asia, the Arab world, Africa and Latin America. And that is why information support is needed from all our people and all friends abroad whose voice can be heard., Today I met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia who visited Ukraine. I thanked him for starting the visit with the topic of restoring Ukraine. In the Zhytomyr region, in the framework of our Fast Recovery Plan, we will begin the construction of the first kindergarten out of fifteen objects that have been proposed to the Estonian Government for help in the reconstruction of the region. This is extremely important right now - when displaced people are returning home., Estonia is one of those countries that started helping us even before February 24 and whose support has become extremely important. Ukraine will always remember this., Switzerland has today joined the European Union's seventh package of sanctions - and I am grateful for that. When such a country does not remain neutral in the protection of values and human morality, it is a very important signal for the whole world., Now it is felt that Russia has begun to realize the inevitability of being recognized as a terrorist state. After all that the Russian army and allegedly private Russian military companies have done, no other terrorist organization in the world can claim primacy in terror. Russia is definitely number one among terrorists. And this definitely deserves legal consequences, in particular, in the decisions of the United States and other world actors., And precisely because of this, a new propaganda activity started in Moscow. They suddenly decided to define ""Azov"" as terrorists, although when a terrorist state does this, it is obviously absurd. They are activating various emissaries with theses that the terrorist state allegedly wants negotiations... If Russia really wanted the end of the war, it would not accumulate its reserves in the south of Ukraine now and would not create mass graves of murdered innocent people on Ukrainian territory., Well, in general, it is simply disgusting when former leaders of powerful states with European values work for Russia, which is fighting against these values., Therefore, we need to fight, we need to beat terrorists on our land, we need to spread information about Ukrainian interests and achieve success and victories for Ukraine. Each and every one at their own level - both Ukrainians and partners. Terror can be stopped only by a joint indomitable force., I signed a new decree on awarding our warriors. 194 combatants were awarded state awards. 28 of them - posthumously., Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by terrorists!, Glory to all who fight for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
3 August 2022  - 13:59 ,The world must make a choice: an end to Russian atrocities or more explosions of Russian bombs - address by the President of Ukraine to students and lecturers of Australian universities,", Dear Mrs. Rector of the Australian National University!, Dear lecturers!, Dear students!, I know that a total of 20 universities in Australia are currently participating in the broadcast. I am grateful for this opportunity to speak with you., Today is the 161st day of the full-scale war launched by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Every day, the world is shocked by new reports about new Russian crimes. This should not become usual for the world. Because it will mean that the world has come to terms., A lot of people worried and maybe still worry about the fact that it is necessary to act delicately and not to anger Russia. Regarding Russia being able to ""save face"". By now it should be obvious to everyone - all this is of no importance. It is impossible to anger those who are mad. It is impossible to save face for someone who does not want it., The Russian Federation has been openly demonstrating this to all states for 161 days in a row. Now it is important not to forget any of them. The world always talks about Russia's actions only in the context of their latest, so to speak, ""current"" atrocity. Now the world must finally put everything together and realize..., He who wants to save face does not erase peaceful cities and villages from the face of the Earth. Does not fire at them with MLRS every day and every night. Does not shoot at residential buildings with cruise missiles. Does not fire cluster munitions or phosphorus bombs at residential areas., Does not fire missiles at the railway station, for example, in the city of Kramatorsk, where hundreds of people were simply waiting for evacuation. Does not fire missiles at Vinnytsia downtown where hundreds of people were just walking. Does not fire missiles at the shopping mall in Kremenchuk, where hundreds of people were buying food or stuff., Does not drop bombs on maternity hospitals and hospitals. Kindergartens, schools and universities. Museums, theaters, churches. Does not direct artillery against cemeteries and does not fire missiles at the memorial complex for the victims of the Holocaust - Babyn Yar., He who wants to save face does not commit thousands of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Does not organize mass executions of civilians. Does not handcuff civilians, does not put them on their knees and does not kill them with a shot in the back of the head. Does not rape women in front of their children and children in front of their mothers., He who wants to save face does not organize blockades of the occupied cities. Does not leave thousands of people without food and drinking water. Does not leave thousands of seriously ill patients without the necessary daily medications. Does not leave people without light, without heating, without connection, without the slightest hope. Does not disrupt humanitarian corridors. Does not take people to forced labor. Does not kidnap children, separating families. Does not leave behind dozens of mass graves., He who wants to save face does not seize nuclear power plants, does not fire at power units with tanks. Does not threaten the world with a nuclear strike and nuclear war. Does not threaten to create an energy crisis. Does not block ports and ships with grain, creating a threat of mass famine on the planet. And after signing the document on the unblocking of ports and free passage of ships, does not fire missiles at the seaport the day after signing!, He who wants to save face does not bring mobile crematoria to burn corpses, to conceal his own atrocities and losses. Does not treat his own soldiers like cannon fodder., Does not treat prisoners of war worse than animals, does not torture, does not organize mass executions, atrocities, terrorist attacks., He who has lost his mind, heart, conscience, dignity and, in general, everything human, does not seek to save face. At least because he lost it a long time ago., Today's Russia lost its face a long time ago. It did not happen yesterday, not the day before yesterday, and not last week. This was simply confirmed once again. Once again, the world saw what was hiding under the mask of a supposed peacemaker, which Russia tried to wear for many years. There is another mask. With slits for eyes and mouth. A mask worn by terrorists., And the only difference between terrorists and Russia is that the first take responsibility for their actions, while Russia does not have the courage to do so and has the audacity to blame others for its crimes. Other countries and the whole world., And now this world faces a choice. Long overdue, not convenient for someone, unpleasant, and for someone - inevitable., You can't hide from it, you can't come off unscathed, you can't let it slide. During the 161 days of the full-scale war in Europe, humanity passed 161 points of no return., For many countries, the time has come when their own interests must yield to the interests of the planet. Because otherwise, both the first and the second will be under threat due to the actions of the world terrorist. Any trade, business, other forms of cooperation with Russia today, first of all, bring not probable benefits to some but probable death to others. Political, economic, energy or any other expediency is equal to the lives of thousands of people today. Who are killed by Russian weapons., The world must make a choice. The UN must make a choice. The UN Security Council must make a choice. The International Committee of the Red Cross must make a choice. The OSCE must make a choice. EU countries must make a choice. NATO countries must make a choice. The G7 and G20 countries must make a choice. The US must make a choice and take this important step. Recognize Russia as a sponsor of terrorism. This time has come. Long ago. The global countdown has started. And then there are only 2 options. Determination, and therefore an end to the crimes and atrocities of Russia, or – more bomb explosions from these terrorists., I know that many Australians send financial aid to our country, donate medications, volunteer in hospitals, ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid and fight on the frontline. So I urge you to continue helping us, helping Ukraine, including in the classrooms. Defending the truth and debunking the myths that the Russian propaganda machine has so masterfully learned to fabricate., I am extremely grateful to the government of Anthony Albanese, just as to the previous Australian government, for the systematic support of our state. Which includes large-scale military and humanitarian aid, sanctions against Russian and Belarusian legal entities and individuals, abolition of tariffs on Ukrainian goods, provision of coal for our energy industry. Today, your country provides the largest military aid to Ukraine among non-NATO countries., We would appreciate your continued assistance. The war is not over. And today, more than ever, we need the support of all civilized countries, together with which we will definitely stop and defeat evil., Thank you for your attention!, Glory to Ukraine!"
2 August 2022  - 21:50 ,Every hryvnia earned by our agricultural workers and restored international relations will contribute to the strengthening of Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today, the first vessel with Ukrainian grain arrived at the Bosphorus, passing through a special corridor in the Black Sea, which was agreed upon to unblock our ports., Our goal now is to have regularity: so that when one ship leaves the port, there are other ships as well - both those loading and those approaching the port. Continuity and regularity is the necessary principle. All consumers of our agricultural products need it., Much has already been said about why it is important to restore Ukrainian agricultural exports. I will add just one detail now. Export this year is needed so that our farmers and agricultural companies have sufficient resources for next year's sowing., This is a matter of food security for our country as well - we are now ensuring next year., Russia provoked the food crisis in order to use the supply of wheat, corn, oil as a weapon... Just as it is already doing with gas and crude oil. Russia creates a deficit, instigates the increase in prices, and when this provokes social unrest, it demands political concessions. It should not work with food., Of course, we understand who we are dealing with. And in Russia, they understand that they are losing one of the opportunities to terrorize the world., But when the world is united, when partners fulfill their commitments, the necessary result can be achieved. Let's see how the grain initiative will work in the coming days., And I want everyone in Ukraine to realize this despite the disinformation campaign about the grain initiative, which is being spread by the enemies of our state... Every hryvnia earned by our agricultural workers and all the restored international ties of Ukraine will contribute to the strengthening of our state., I spoke today with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Of course, the key theme is the defense support of our struggle for freedom, this is an interaction that we must strengthen constantly for our common interests., OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland Zbigniew Rau was in Kyiv today - I thanked him for the support., In negotiations with both Mr. Stoltenberg and Mr. Rau, I paid special attention to the issue of our prisoners of war kept by Russia. In particular, this also applies to the Russian terrorist attack in Olenivka, which must become an ultimate argument for all civilized countries of the world to officially recognize Russia as a terrorist state., What else is needed for this? Isn't this a sufficiently brutal and obvious act of terrorism for the relevant decisions to recognize Russia as a terrorist state to be made in the major capitals of the world?, Of course, the occupiers receive a fundamental response to all their crimes on the battlefield. In this context, today I want to thank President of the United States Biden and the entire American people for the new package of defense support for Ukraine., The word ""HIMARS"" has become almost synonymous with the word ""justice"" for our country, and the Ukrainian defense forces will do everything to ensure that the occupiers experience more and more painful losses every week thanks to these very effective systems., Yes, indeed, we still cannot completely break the advantage of the Russian army in artillery and in manpower, and this is very tangible in the battles, especially in Donbas - Pisky, Avdiivka, other directions. It's just hell there. It can't even be described in words..., And every Ukrainian must always be grateful to our warriors who defend Ukrainian positions there despite the terrorists' significant fire superiority., But every day our diplomats and all other representatives of our state do everything possible and everything impossible to get the weapons that will ultimately help Ukraine stop this horde and to convince everyone who still has doubts about the supplies., Today I also thank these people - each and every one who ensures the supply of weapons, who promotes the necessary decisions in partner states, who literally lives in these arms negotiations., We also have new decisions to strengthen sanctions against Russia for the war - the United States and Canada have expanded the list of individuals and legal entities against whom restrictions have been applied., This is the right way, and it is necessary for the European Union to fill in the sanctions pause as soon as possible by adopting a new package of sanctions against the terrorist state. We will work on this in the coming weeks., In the evening, I signed decrees awarding our defenders. 167 warriors of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards, 32 of them posthumously. Another decree awarded 16 intelligence officers, 1 of them posthumously. Also - 122 employees of the Security Service of Ukraine, 2 - posthumously., Eternal memory to all who gave lives for Ukraine!, Eternal glory to all who fight for independence!, Glory to Ukraine!"
1 August 2022  - 22:22 ,The power of the democratic world is well felt on the battlefield in Ukraine these weeks - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, The implementation of the Initiative on the export of Ukrainian grain and other agricultural products from our ports in the Black Sea began today. The first vessel carrying 26,000 tons of corn left the port of Odesa., As of now, it is too early to draw any conclusions and predict further events. But the port started working, the export traffic started, and this can be called the first positive signal that there is a chance to stop the spread of the food crisis in the world., Currently, everything depends on the implementation of the security parameters of the Initiative, which is the responsibility of the partners, primarily the United Nations and Turkey., We cannot have the illusions that Russia will simply refrain from trying to disrupt Ukrainian exports. Russia consistently provoked famine in the countries of Africa and Asia, which traditionally imported large volumes of Ukrainian food. And now - in conditions of extreme heat, as this year in Europe, the threat of a price crisis and a certain food shortage is also possible for some European countries., So, we’ll see how the agreements will work and whether there will really be security. 16 vessels are already waiting their turn for departure, and we are ready to make a proper contribution to the stabilization of the world food market., For our state, this is also of great benefit - and this is not only about billions of dollars in foreign exchange revenue. About half a million Ukrainians are involved in the cultivation of agricultural export crops, and if we add related industries, then this is plus a million jobs. That is why there is the appropriate state attention to the implementation of the export Initiative. Our people really need it., Today I spoke with President of France Emmanuel Macron, in particular about the restoration of our agricultural exports by sea. In general, the negotiations lasted one and a half hours and were very meaningful: relations in the defense sphere, first of all. A wide range of security issues - thank you for the assistance already given to Ukraine, which effectively protects us on the battlefield., We also discussed macro-financial support for our state - I asked Mr. President to help us unblock macro-financial aid, which has stalled in Europe. I want to remind all the leaders that it is 9 billion euros. These are not trifles for us, but important social things - these are our pensions, these are our salaries, support for IDPs, and therefore we expect appropriate decisions from specific government officials., Mr. President of France informed me about the results of his African tour - we are now strengthening this direction of our foreign policy. I invited President Macron to participate in the online summit of the Crimea Platform, which will take place shortly., Last year, we created the Crimea Platform and are developing this format – despite all the threats and tangible diplomatic opposition from Russia., During the years of occupation, Russia turned Crimea into a large military prison camp - and tens of thousands of people became its victims. Crimea became a bridgehead for attacks on the free territory of our country... The weak and insufficiently principled reaction to the occupation of Crimea in 2014 and in the following years became one of the prerequisites for the fact that Russian aggression managed to grow to such a scale. We will gradually restore justice regarding our Crimea., The situation on the battlefield has not undergone significant changes over the past day. Fierce battles continue in Donbas, in the Kharkiv region, the struggle for the south of our country continues..., Ukrainian artillery and intelligence have already done a lot to reduce the fire potential of the occupiers - and it is tangible. Today I want to thank all our warriors who destroy Russian logistics, who destroy the occupiers' ammunition and who do not leave the occupiers a single safe place on our land., And I also want to thank our partners now - everyone who supplies Ukraine with modern and effective artillery and MLRS. The power of the democratic world is well felt on the battlefield in Ukraine these weeks., And today, another conversation took place in the format Ukraine - United States - three on three - Andriy Yermak and Jacob Sullivan, Dmytro Kuleba and Antony Blinken, Valerii Zaluzhny and Mark Milley. This is our continuous format, which has already allowed us to make a fundamental contribution to the protection of the entire free world. We’ve coordinated next steps in support of Ukraine., Eternal glory to everyone who fights for freedom!, Glory to Ukraine!"
31 July 2022  - 22:11 ,"Ukraine and our people, our capabilities are more powerful than any Russian missiles - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Ukrainians!, Today, one of the most brutal shellings of Mykolaiv and the region over the entire period of the full-scale war took place. Dozens of missiles and rockets... The occupiers hit residential buildings, schools, other social infrastructure, and industrial facilities., The Russian attack took the lives of Oleksiy Vadaturskyi and his wife Raisa, the founder of one of the largest Ukrainian agricultural companies ""Nibulon"", the Hero of Ukraine. My sincere condolences to the relatives and friends of the Vadaturskyi couple., It is exactly such people, such companies, our Ukrainian south that have guaranteed the world's food security. It has always been so. And it will be so again. The Russian terrorists should not even hope that they will be able to destroy the social and industrial potential of Ukraine and walk through the ruins., Ukraine and our people, our capabilities are definitely more powerful than any Russian missiles and shells., Now the Russian army is trying to strengthen its positions in the occupied areas of the south of our country, increasing activity in the relevant areas. Part of the Russian forces from their positions in the east are moved to the south - to the Kherson region and the Zaporizhzhia region... But this will not help them there., None of the Russian strikes goes unanswered by our military and intelligence officers. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are ready to respond to any new activity of the occupiers., And today I want to thank every resident of Mykolaiv for their indomitability, for protecting the city and the region. I also thank Nikopol, Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih and the entire Dnipropetrovsk region, the strong people of Zaporizhzhia and the region, all Ukrainians of the Kherson region, everyone who defends the outskirts of Odesa and the region... Thank you for your courage!, Strategically, Russia has no chance of winning this war. And it is necessary to hold on, so that even at the tactical levels, the terrorist state feels its defeat. We have to hold on in the south, in the east and everywhere. We have to hold on in defense, diplomacy and politics. To preserve our unity - and not only until the victory, but also after it, in order to qualitatively restore everything destroyed by the occupiers. I believe that we will do all this., I signed several important laws today, in particular the law on providing additional guarantees of protection to media representatives working in the areas of hostilities. This will strengthen the protection of our journalists., The law on ensuring the rights and freedoms of IDPs is eliminating bureaucratic barriers that limited assistance to people., The law on the protection of the civilian population in the event of emergency situations and hostilities., Also, the law that creates conditions for comprehensive thermal modernization of buildings and simplifies the process of restoring the residential sector damaged by the strikes of the occupiers., Important ratification laws, some other acts as well., We are preparing for a new week - as always, full of international activity. Already tomorrow there will be important negotiations with European partners. In a few days I will continue delivering speeches to the international community, communicating with different audiences - it is very important, in particular with the student audience., No matter what happens and no matter what the occupiers’ plans are, we must do our job - protect our state and take care of each other., The more effective we are in this - all of us, all citizens of Ukraine - the faster we will achieve victory., Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
30 July 2022  - 22:22 ,"Recognition of Russia as terrorist state needed not as political gesture, but as effective defense of free world – address of President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians!, During this day, our state received many signals from different countries condemning the Russian terrorist act in Olenivka. The world sees the truth. And I thank all our partners who are ready to join in establishing all the circumstances of this terrible execution of our prisoners., All evidence of this crime committed by the occupiers will be collected. Everyone is guilty – who approved, who organized, who blasted these people, who knew about it – they all will be found. But still, this is not enough now., There must be legal steps on the part of the world community against the terrorist state. Condemnation at the level of political rhetoric is not enough for this mass murder. What relationship can be with the terrorist after that? What kind of business can be done with such a country?, Ukrainian diplomats and all friends of Ukraine abroad will increase their activity even more to track and destroy all those connections of the terrorist state with the free world, which Russia still uses., And formal legal recognition of Russia as a terrorist state, in particular, recognition by the United States Department of State, is needed not as a political gesture, but as an effective defense of the free world. This decision will automatically make it difficult for the terrorist state to exist, and will automatically cut various political and business ties that Russia would maintain otherwise., And all this will happen one hundred percent. It will have to be done – it's only a matter of time and the format of making this decision. And the sooner it happens, the less evil Russia will have time to do., It is important to hear exactly the same motivation now for all our people who still remain in Donbas, in the areas of the fiercest fighting. There are hundreds of thousands of people, tens of thousands of children... Many of people refuse to leave... But it really needs to be done. This decision will still have to be made. Anyway! Believe me., And the sooner it is done, the more people leave Donetsk region now, the fewer people the Russian army will have time to kill., Therefore, if you have the opportunity, please talk to those who still remain in the combat zones in Donbas. Please convince them that it is necessary to leave, especially if they are families with children. If you have the opportunity to help displaced people, do it., There is a government decision on mandatory evacuation from Donetsk region, everything is being organized. Full support, full assistance – both logistical and payments. We only need a decision from the people themselves, who have not yet made it for themselves. Go, we will help., We are not Russia. That is why every life is important for us. And we will use all available opportunities to save as many lives as possible and to limit Russian terror as much as possible., At this stage of the war, terror is the main weapon for Russia. And that is why the main task of every Ukrainian, every defender of freedom and humanity in the world is to do everything to isolate the terrorist state and to protect as many people as possible from Russian attacks., I am grateful to everyone who is fighting for Ukraine! To our heroes!, Grateful to everyone who saves our people from this Russian terror!, We will defeat everyone!, Glory to Ukraine!"
29 July 2022  - 23:51 ,Our diplomats bring information about Russian attack on Olenivka to highest international level; Russia won't be able to lie to anyone – address of President of Ukraine,", Dear Ukrainian men and women!, Dear all our defenders!, I am returning from Odesa region. In particular, today I met with our heroes – soldiers of the Special Operations Forces., I thanked them for their service, awarded the best and emphasized that their main task is to ensure that the enemy did not have a single calm moment on this land. The land must burn under their feet., Every occupier who abuses Ukrainians, who tortures and kills, should know that there will be punishment for this. If some of the Russian killers hope that they will not be brought to justice, that they will hide somewhere, let them know – they will answer in any case. Geography, time, borders, walls will not stop a just retribution., I heard reports today about the attack of the occupiers on Olenivka, Donetsk region. It was a deliberate Russian war crime, a deliberate mass murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war. More than 50 dead..., When the defenders of Azovstal left the plant, the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross acted as guarantors of the life and health of our soldiers. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Security Service, the Main Intelligence Directorate and the representative of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine issued a joint statement addressing to the UN and the Red Cross as guarantors of those agreements regarding the defenders of Azovstal. I support this statement. Now the guarantors must react. They must protect the lives of hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war., And I add on my own: there should be a clear legal recognition of Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. I am especially appealing to the United States of America – a solution is needed, needed now., Russia has proven with numerous terrorist attacks that it is the biggest source of terrorism in the world today. It's a fact., Ukrainian diplomats brought the information about the Russian attack on Olenivka to the highest international level. The UN Security Council has been informed. All participants in international relations will know what really happened. Russia won't be able to lie to anyone., The international community is also informed about all the details of our resistance to Russian hunger terror., Concrete work on the restoration of Ukrainian grain exports began today in Odesa. It's important. It's important not only from the point of view of the economic strength of our state, which is needed to withstand this war. It's important for the world to withstand the pressure of the food crisis. The more Ukrainian grain is on the global market, the more stable the situation with our partners will be, and therefore our joint countermeasures against the terrorist state will be more effective. I emphasize – a terrorist state., I don't want to make any forecast now – let's see how the agreements on grain export will be implemented. The UN, Turkey and other international partners are responsible for the security side of this process., The Armed Forces of Ukraine do everything necessary to protect our coast., I want to say one more thing today. Russian terror is primarily aimed at breaking our inner strength. Russia cannot do anything to us on the battlefield. Our defenders are very strong. You and I should be just as strong., Our emotions, our common will to fight must be strong until our very victory. No matter what the occupiers do, no matter how they try to break our spirit, we must hold on, be mobilized and fully focused on what is necessary for our victory., If any of you feel that you cannot stand the evil that you see, think about how else you can personally help the defense of Ukraine., Help the Armed Forces! Tell the world the facts about Russian terror! And convince everyone you know in partner countries to increase aid to Ukraine., We will definitely win. But we have to come to that. We are all together., Eternal memory to all victims of Russian terror!, Eternal glory to each and every one who destroys these occupiers!, Glory to Ukraine!"
28 July 2022  - 23:22 ,"No one in the world invests in terrorism more than Russia, and this requires a legal response - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today, we celebrated the Day of Ukrainian Statehood for the first time. And I was happy to see how many people perceived this holiday warmly, congratulated on it, smiled and were proud of Ukraine., It seems that we should have celebrated such a day for many, many years - it is so logical. But this holiday was established only last year. Well, it is forever now., During a solemn meeting in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, I presented combat awards to our warriors - ""Crosses of Combat Merit"". In particular, to Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrskyi, Commander of the Khortytsia Operational-Strategic Command, Major-General Andriy Kovalchuk, Brigadier-General Andriy Hnatov, Brigadier-General Mykhailo Drapaty, Colonels Yevhen Bulatsyk, Mykola Mishakin and Oleh Fedoriv, ​​Lieutenant-Colonel Pavlo Rozlach, Majors Ruslan Maryshev and Denys Nokhrin, Captain Dmytro Berehovy, Senior Lieutenants Dmytro Linnyk and Anatoliy Tantsyura, Medical Service Lieutenant Yulia Holovna, Sergeant Pavlina Mykolayevych, Staff Sergeant Roman Palamarchuk, Junior Sergeant Oleksandr Rohachevsky, Senior Sailor Olena Zablotska and Private Serhiy Mishchenko. Thank you all for your service and performance in battles!, Today, in the Mariyinsky Palace, I handed out the passports of the citizens of our state to young Ukrainians - boys and girls who were forced to leave their homes due to hostilities, young volunteers, winners of the All-Ukrainian Olympics, children of our warriors who defend Ukraine, children of those who gave life for the independence of the state. An inspiring ceremony that affirms the power of Ukrainian citizenship! The future of Ukraine is in such children, in their sincerity and intelligence. I am proud to be the President of such citizens., I had the honor to thank one of our greatest friends - Mr. President of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda for the support and extremely important things that strengthened our defense. President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola - a principled friend of ours in European structures - addressed the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in a special format., There were important phone conversations. In the morning - with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. I thanked him for his prayers for Ukraine, for his wishes of victory and peace. In the evening, I spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte - very meaningfully about our future cooperation., I held another meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. We considered four issues. What can be said publicly now: we analyzed the current state of providing weapons to our defenders, the supply of aid from partners and, in general, the state of implementation of the Defense Plan of Ukraine, which was put into effect on February 24., Only in the first half of this day, and only in Kyiv, there were four air alarms. The Russian army launched missile attacks on the Kyiv region, Kropyvnytskyi, hit Mykolaiv, continued a series of strategically senseless and brutal onslaughts on Donbas... I thank each and every one who repels this terror., And I also want to thank the American senators who unanimously approved the resolution calling on the US Department of State to recognize Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. You can take any day in Ukraine - today or any other after February 24 - to see that no one in the world invests in terrorism more than Russia. This really needs a legal response at the global level. And there is no rational reason why such a reaction should not occur, particularly in the United States., We continue to accumulate international humanitarian support. I am glad that Demna, the creative director of the Balenciaga fashion house, has become the new ambassador of the United24 state charity platform. He told me that the decision to become a United24 ambassador was related to his personal story, as he had experienced the trauma of being a refugee. Demna will help Ukraine in the direction of reconstruction. Let me remind you that Andriy Shevchenko, Elina Svitolina, Liev Schreiber and Imagine Dragons have already become ambassadors of United24., We will do everything so that there is no indifference left in the world towards this terrible war that Russia has unleashed against our state and against the very idea of freedom., We will definitely win!, Congratulations once again on the Day of Ukrainian Statehood!, Glory to Ukraine!"
28 July 2022  - 16:15 ,Speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Verkhovna Rada session on the occasion of the Day of Ukrainian Statehood,", Dear Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine,, Dear friend Gitanas,, Dear Mrs. President Roberta Metsola,, Dear deputies, dear government officials,, Dear military,, And all our citizens of Ukraine!, We are citizens of the strongest state in the world. The state that is at war. The state, which at the same time is being reformed. And the state that ensured the most powerful unification of democracies in history., The state, which on the 155th day of Russia's full-scale war against us, has the strength to celebrate its day - the Day of Ukrainian Statehood., We ensured that the values of the free world did not remain mere rhetoric and actually started working to protect civilization. We made the European Union the most united in all the years of its existence, and it is getting stronger thanks to our strength. We ensured that all the tyrants of this world saw the potential of democracy., This was done by us, the citizens of Ukraine. All of us - military and civilians, diplomats and volunteers, civil servants and businesses, politicians, social leaders and media... Each and every one who worked conscientiously at his and her level for the sake of one thing - for the sake of Ukraine, one’s family and our future., We, the citizens of a state, which has over a thousand years of history, did it. Over a thousand years of its culture. Over a thousand years of its character - Ukrainian character, unbreakable one. Which endured on our land under the hits of many invaders..., Where have you come, the Russian army blinded by your pathetic ambitions? You’ve come up against us - those who were prepared for this crucial war for independence by dozens and dozens of generations of the Ukrainian people who lived and live here, who fought and fight here, who built and build here and who dreamed and dreams above everything else that there is no someone else’s rule over them and Ukraine. It's time for this dream to become a reality forever., This is our time! We will make this dream come true., We will become not a new legend of heroic resistance, but a state of winners. Not 300 Spartans, worthy of films, books and plays, but the multimillion-strong nation-hero which is worthy of living, worthy of winning and which will teach others in the world how to defend themselves and how to win. We will be remembered not as those who tried, but as those who preserved, strengthened and passed our state to our children so that they could pass it on to their children. A free, strong, modern and efficient state., We will do it - we, citizens of Ukraine., Friend Gitanas Nausėda, dear Mr. President! I want to thank you and - in your person - the entire Lithuanian people today, on the Day of our Statehood, for the significant, important, heroic support that Ukraine received. Thank you!, It was not politics for our states - it reflects the equally strong love for freedom of our nations. Nations who walked and keep walking together through European history. Thank you again!, Mrs. Roberta, Mrs. President of the European Parliament! I would like to note your bravery. You visited Kyiv at a time when the invaders’ army was threatening our capital, and you were the first among the heads of EU institutions to do so. At that time we saw our character in your bravery, we saw our person - a person who will always defend the values of Europe and will not betray freedom. I am thankful to you!, I am thankful to all friends and partners of Ukraine - both from large states and from geographically smaller ones yet whose will is not inferior to the will of the largest. I am grateful to everyone who helps Ukrainians destroy evil!, Due to the cruelty of history - after several unfortunate historic turns - our state was not mentioned for some time. Then they’ve been saying that Ukraine is somewhere next to Russia, or is even allegedly a part of it. We know that now they definitely know - Ukraine is the only state in the world that has the bravery to beat Russia. Beat on our land notwithstanding any of its threats., It is important that we make others fall in love with our Ukrainian indomitability. It is important that we are all a state that functions for the sake of Ukrainian interests and is reckoned with by everyone in the world. It is important that we are a democratic state that is strengthening its institutions even now, especially now - during such a devastating war., We applied to join the European Union and were granted candidacy with speed and under conditions unprecedented for any other state. This is our development. These are our friends, their help. These are our interests. This is Ukrainian speed - what we became capable of when we freed ourselves from illusions and achieved the greatest national unity in history. Glory to Ukraine!, It is with the same speed that we should come to the beginning of negotiations regarding Ukraine's membership in the European Union. We will do everything we have to for this. We will synchronize the legislation of Ukraine with the law of the European Union., A plan for the implementation of all EU regulations and directives as part of the fulfillment of the Association Agreement with the European Union has also been formed. This is actually a joint task for us, for you, dear deputies, and for the Government of our country., And this corresponds to our new reality. The fact that we have transferred the process of European integration from the sphere of foreign policy to the sphere of domestic policy. This is where real work, real European integration, starts., Ukraine has always been Europe. Our values have always been European. Our state-building experience of different times is a European experience. And now we have come to the point where our state system is institutionally becoming Europe., We have started the process of de-oligarchization - a registry is being formed that is ready to put the oligarchs under the power of society., I have signed a decree on the creation of a competition commission for the selection of candidates for the High Council of Justice, and thanks to this and other steps, we will do everything to ensure that the fundamental judicial reform provides every Ukrainian with access to honest and competent justice., Today, the new Prosecutor General finalized the appointment of the new head of the Specialized Anticorruption Prosecutor's Office with his first decision., And it is an honor for me to announce another very important step now. The European Union has the College of Europe in Bruges and Natolin, which are some of the most prestigious institutions of postgraduate education that prepare professionals to work in institutions of the EU and member states. We are establishing our College of Europe in Ukraine., A corresponding memorandum has already been signed between the Government of Ukraine and the College of Europe in Natolin. At the first stage, a faculty of European integration will be established in one of the Ukrainian higher education institutions, and later, on its basis, the College of Europe in the framework of the Presidential University will be established., And although I have been told that this will not be resolved in months, as I have been told many times on other issues, I know that the creation of our College of Europe will not take long. I'm sure it will start working shortly. We already have this experience - to turn into months what was supposed to take years and decades, and into weeks - what was supposed to take months., Such a College will become not only a professional basis for the European policy of Ukraine as a member of the EU, but also our contribution to the development of European institutions. This is what we, the citizens of Ukraine, are capable of. This is our statehood., We showed strength in battles and united the world with the best emotions that people have. We fight against the terror of the occupiers, we defend humanity for all nations. We guarantee that the borders of Europe will never again move further west than our eastern state border. And we make our state and public institutions advanced., And when today, on this Day of Ukrainian Statehood, here, in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, before the eyes of the entire Ukrainian people, I will honor strong people for strong deeds with the Cross of Combat Merit, I want all Ukrainians to feel: we are behind those who defend our country on the battlefield, and behind our backs - the backs of millions of Ukrainians living now - there are those who have been creating Ukrainian history, Ukrainian culture and Ukrainian character for centuries., We must be worthy of the height of our people, all its generations, and the thousand-year weight of our statehood., I congratulate you all on the holiday!, I am thankful to our heroes!, Glory to Ukraine!"
28 July 2022  - 10:41 ,"All stages of the history of Ukrainian statehood can be described in one sentence: we existed, exist and will exist - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the occasion of Ukrainian Statehood Day",", The great people of the great country and the great state, which existed on this land from time immemorial, and from time immemorial there have been attempts to both enslave and destroy it. By many people and many times. And which has not allowed it to be done from time immemorial. Never to anyone., The state in which the history of Christianity in Eastern Europe began, when it was baptized 1034 years ago by the Great Prince Volodymyr of Kyiv., The state in which the history of indomitability began, which is now admired by all of Europe and the whole world. This is our state. Our country. This is Ukraine., The history of its state formation dates back thousands of years. But only this year we celebrate the Day of Ukrainian Statehood for the first time., We do not need fireworks and pomp to show the importance of our own statehood for the Ukrainian people. Today we defend it with weapons in hands. For 155 days in a row. We can say that for us, Statehood Day is every day., Every day we fight so that everyone on the planet finally understands: we are not a colony, not an enclave, not a protectorate. Not a gubernia, an eyalet or a crown land, not a part of foreign empires, not a ""part of the land"", not a union republic. Not an autonomy, not a province, but a free, independent, sovereign, indivisible and independent state., It originates at least one and a half thousand years ago. Since the date officially recognized by the UN and UNESCO, when Kyi, Shchek, Khoryv and Lybid founded the capital of Ukraine., It is the only legal heiress of Kyivan Rus’, the possessions and achievements of our rulers. Askold and Dir, Vishchy Oleg, Prince Igor, Equal-to-the-Apostles Princess Olga, Sviatoslav the Brave, Volodymyr the Great, Yaroslav the Wise, Volodymyr Monomakh, King Danylo., It is the heiress of the Cossack State. Homeland of Bayda Vyshnevetsky, Sahaidachny, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Ivan Mazepa, Pylyp Orlyk., It is the legal successor of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the Ukrainian State of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi. Independence and unity proclaimed by the universals of the Central Rada and the Unification Act., It has a rich tradition of law-making, writing and diplomacy. ""Rus’ka Pravda"", Annales Bertiniani, Ostromyr Gospels, Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk and hundreds of other sources and documents that contain written references to our state and its recognition by other states and rulers., It has glorious military traditions. It is the homeland of famous warriors, indomitable fighters for their own freedom and statehood. In Rus’, in Sich, on the battlefields of the First and Second World Wars. In Kholodny Yar, in the Carpathian forests, near Kruty., All stages of the history of Ukraine's statehood, its defense and struggle for it can be described in one sentence: we existed, exist and will exist!, We will exist, because our state has incredible sons and daughters who have stood up for its defense. The names of Sviatoslav the Brave, King Danylo, Hetmans Sahaidachny, Khmelnytsky, Vyhovsky, Apostol, generals Handziuk and Almazov are written on their war flags and khorugvs. They bear the honorific names of ""Knights of the Winter Campaign"", ""Sich Riflemen"", ""Chorni Zaporozhtsi"" and ""Kholodnoyarivtsi"". They and millions of our other warriors defend Ukraine under the names of their ancestors. With responsibility to them. And we feel their support. The support of all generations of fighters for an independent Ukraine., Our warriors defend Ukraine on the ground, in the water and in the air. Our ancestors defend it from the skies. And all of them together are our angels. Our angels have wings. But under them there are weapons. We never take weapons first. But if our home is attacked, we stand to the last. Because, losing its own state, any nation loses primarily not its territory. Not hectares or square kilometers of land or water. When a nation loses its own state, it loses its own face. Its own name. Its originality, identity, memory, and with them its heart and soul. And this is much scarier for us than enemy armies, planes, missiles and tanks., That is why millions of us are ready to stop them without fear. And defend the most valuable at the cost of one's life. Because having lost what is meaningful to us, we lose the meaning of life itself. Because for us, living in captivity is not living. Being dependent is not being. Because a non-independent and unfree Ukraine is not Ukraine., We do not know the word ""slavery"". It is in our dictionaries, but not in our heads. We will give our last shirt, we will give everything we have for what is in our heart. That is why we will fight for our statehood to the last - the last breath, the last bullet, the last soldier. Not ours, but the enemy's. We will live to fight and fight to live. We will not give up until we drive the last occupier out of our home. We will not stop until we liberate the last meter of Ukrainian land. We will not rest until we liberate our last village, our last house, our last well, our last cherry tree, our last willow tree!, It will be so. And it will only be so! Because for us and for the occupier, all this has completely different, polar meanings. Targets for them are shrines for us. Unknown names on the map for them are places familiar from childhood for us. They fulfill other people's criminal orders, we fulfill our sacred duty., We are fighting for different things, so the end of this battle will also be different for both of us. By meaning. And even by the sound. In Russian, this is the failure of a special operation., In Ukrainian, this is victory in the war!, That is why it will happen. That is why our state will exist., Congratulations on the Day of Christianization of Kyivan Rus’ - Ukraine!, Congratulations on Ukrainian Statehood Day!, Glory to Ukraine!"
27 July 2022  - 22:45 ,"Every week we strengthen Ukraine, get closer to the European Union, provide forces to confront Russia - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, A brief report on the passing day., First of all, about the Antonivsky bridge in Kherson and other crossings in the region. Of course, they will all be rebuilt, but by us already., We are doing everything to ensure that the occupiers do not have any logistical opportunities on our land., Whatever plans they have, we will disrupt them. And we will liberate our territory with military, diplomatic and all other available means until we reach the legal borders of Ukraine., Second, today the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine approved the appointment of a new Prosecutor General, Andriy Kostin. The person is decent, professional, he knows how to work systematically. Society considers the provision of everything necessary to hold Russia accountable for the war as one of his most important tasks. This is cooperation with the International Criminal Court, with partner states that help identify specific culprits among the Russian military; this is the recording of the facts of the crimes committed by the occupiers, ensuring the formation of an evidentiary base for the criminal prosecution of every war criminal. The Prosecutor General's Office is one of the key institutions working to hold all Russian murderers and torturers accountable for their crimes against Ukrainians., Third, we are preparing to increase our export of electricity to consumers in the European Union. Despite such a war, we ensured the connection of the energy grid of Ukraine to the energy system of the entire Europe in record time. Our exports allow us not only to earn foreign currency, but also to help our partners withstand Russian energy pressure., We will gradually make Ukraine one of the guarantors of European energy security thanks to our domestic electricity production., Fourth, we are preparing for very important political and diplomatic events scheduled for the second half of this week. First of all, this concerns tomorrow's celebration of the Day of Ukrainian Statehood. But not only that. There will be more events, there will be more news. Every week we strengthen our state, every week we do things that bring us closer to the European Union, and every week we provide additional forces to confront Russia., Fifth, a joint meeting of the International Sanctions Group was held today under the leadership of Andriy Yermak and Michael McFaul with the participation of representatives of the Ukrainian Parliament – the leadership of the Verkhovna Rada, factions and groups. New solutions are being developed that will increase the price for the war for Russia. In particular, there is an initiative to strengthen responsibility at the level of the European Union for evasion of sanctions and an initiative on mandatory disclosure of information about any business contacts, joint ownership of corporate rights and property with citizens of Russia. The Yermak-McFaul sanctions group will coordinate its work with representatives of our parliament., And one more thing., During the full-scale war, I awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine to 160 Ukrainian warriors. And among them is one of the most effective Ukrainian pilots, Major Oleksandr Kukurba. In April, in the Mariyinsky Palace, in the White Hall of Heroes of Ukraine, I presented the Gold Star Order to him. Major Kukurba died in battle yesterday. It was his hundredth combat sortie. A real Ukrainian hero whom we will always remember., Eternal memory to all who died for Ukraine!, Glory to everyone who defends our state!, Glory to Ukraine!"
26 July 2022  - 22:38 ,"Ukrainian bravery inspires all free nations, and just imagine how inspiring our victory will be - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Ukrainians!, Unbreakable people of the strongest country!, Today, the occupiers hit the Odesa region again, firing missiles at ordinary houses again. Missiles designed to destroy warships and other significant targets. It is with such heavy weapons that the Russian army destroys the ordinary private sector near the sea. People lived and had a vacation there..., And we will certainly hit back for this, no matter what lies the Russian Ministry of Defense tells about such strikes. The constant Russian terror of Kharkiv and the region, Mykolaiv, towns and villages of the Zaporizhzhia region and Dnipropetrovsk region, Donbas, border areas of the Sumy region and Chernihiv region - for all this the occupiers will not go unpnished., For four months, the Russian state has not provided to its citizens any information - even censored - about the losses of the occupation contingent. Total silence. Nothing was published or said in numerous interviews and speeches at the political and military levels. However, this number is already almost 40,000 - that is how many killed people the Russian army has lost since February 24. And tens of thousands more were wounded and maimed., And if the Russian state does not say this officially, even in general terms, everyone who still has any contacts in Russia or informational influence on their society should convey this simple fact to whomever possible. Among the occupiers only those killed are 40 thousand., Today it became known that Britain has expanded the list of sanctions against Russia. Dozens more people and organizations were added. This is the right trend, and I am grateful to Britain for its unwavering firmness in sanctions matters. This is an example that should be followed by everyone else in the Western world., In particular, today's news about another provoked increase in gas prices on the European market above 2,000 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters is already a sufficient reason to expand sanctions against Russia. Because it is clear to everyone that this is a deliberate price terror by Russia against Europe. Using Gazprom, Moscow is doing everything to make this winter the toughest for European countries. It is necessary to respond to terror - respond with sanctions., Today, for the first time in the history of interstate relations between Ukraine and Uruguay, I held negotiations with Mr. President of this Latin American country. I thanked for support in international organizations and called on Uruguay, like other states in the Latin American region, to impose sanctions on Russia. We will do everything so that there is not a single region left in the world where the truth about Russian aggression is not understood. We already have communication with Chile, Paraguay, Costa Rica. And now - Uruguay. We’ll continue this work., And a few more significant events that are worth mentioning. Today, the Winston Churchill Leadership Award ceremony was held in London with the participation of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. I believe that this is an award of all our heroes, all our people, all of us who are resisting tyranny each at their own level. And it was really an honor for me to receive this award., Today, in the Netherlands - a country for the understanding of which we’ve been working for a long time - the Ukrainian people were honored with another award - a special Dutch Independence Award. Our ambassador received it on behalf of Ukrainians., These iconic things also reflect the radical changes in the attitude towards Ukraine that have taken place in the world. Our bravery is truly an inspiration for all free nations and the community of democracies in general. And just imagine how inspiring the Ukrainian victory will be., In the evening, I signed a decree awarding our warriors. 198 combatants were awarded state awards of Ukraine. Two of them – posthumously., Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine!, Eternal glory to all those who fight for the independence of our country!, Glory to Ukraine!"
26 July 2022  - 20:20 ,The democracies of the world are capable of stopping any tyranny - speech by the President of Ukraine during the awarding of the Winston Churchill Leadership Award ,", Friend Boris!, Dear members of the Churchill Society!, Dear members of the Ukrainian Warrior Games team, I know that you are also there!, Dear guests!, It is an extraordinary honor for me to receive such a leadership award today. And, receiving it, it is very appropriate to recall one of the most famous words of Winston Churchill, which he said on May 8, 1945, after the end of the war in Europe: ""My dear friends, this is your hour. This is not victory of a party or of any class. It's a victory of the great British nation as a whole""., And now I can quite rightly say that this award is not only for me and it reflects not only my efforts. It would not be possible without all of us, it would not be possible without one hundred and sixty Ukrainian soldiers who were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine for the period from February 24. It would not be possible without more than twenty-four thousand Ukrainian men and women who have been awarded our state awards for bravery in the battles against the Russian terrorist invasion. This award would not be possible if the entire Ukrainian people had not risen up to defend freedom from the attack of tyranny, as Boris said now, a tyranny that is trying to return us to the worst that happened in the XX century and that was then defeated thanks to the factor of Churchill in particular., But not only. Not only this is reflected now. Something else should be said as well., Ukrainians and European history will always remember those who did not hesitate to come to the aid of our people and the very idea of freedom., Addressing Londoners celebrating the victory, Winston Churchill recalled that Britain had stood alone for a whole year against the greatest military power of the time. And it did not quit the struggle, did not obey. And it created an example for all nations fighting against tyranny. An example of the fact that victory is possible if you remember what honor is and do not deviate from your principles., When we celebrate our victory, which we surely will, we will be able to say, thankfully, a little bit different words than those said by Sir Churchill., Because Ukraine was not left alone after February 24. With us were those who helped us, who remembered at the worst time what honor is, and who ""had no thought of quitting the struggle""., I'm talking about you now, Boris. This award is yours, too. This showed our joint leadership - Ukrainians, British and everyone who will never give up freedom to some tyrants, no matter what weapon they use against us., The price of freedom is extremely high. But still, it is incomparably higher for those who gave it up and are trying to return it than for those who protect it with all their might., We are defending. We are fighting. Just like during the terrible trials of the XX century., Just as then, the factor of personal leadership is now crucial. Leadership on the battlefield. Leadership in helping the active army. Leadership in international relations. And although the stakes in this war are different, they are no less high than 80 years ago., What are we fighting for now?, Not just for the land, although for it too, of course. Not just for human rights or the right of one nation, the Ukrainians, to live independently, although for them too, of course. Not just for freedom in Europe or everywhere on the borders of Russia, although it will be guaranteed as a consequence of our victory., We are fighting together to ensure that war is never again seen by any aggressor as a means of achieving aggressive goals., And perhaps for the first time in the history of mankind we are now able to show everyone in the world and for ages that democracies, united, can stop any tyranny, even if at first it seems that it has unlimited resources for aggression., But this can become a reality only if Russia loses on the battlefield in Ukraine., That is why it is necessary to continue the supply of modern and effective weapons to our state in sufficient quantities to finally break the offensive potential of Russian tyranny. Sanctions against Russia must be strengthened and applied against all those who commit or support terror. And it is necessary to involve more nations in our coalition for the defense of freedom - especially those against whom Russia in the XXI century decided to use one of the most terrible types of weapons - hunger, artificial hunger., The democracies of the world are capable of stopping any tyranny. We are capable of stopping any evil that threatens our freedom. Only the joint leadership of the entire free world can be enough for this., And patience should be enough. Patience on the way to victory. No one knows today how much time and effort it will take to reach it., However, the victory is worth the effort. And it will become our shared history. So outstanding that you and I will later be quoted in the same way as we are now quoting Sir Churchill., Thank you for your attention!, Thank you for the award - the award of the people of Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
25 July 2022  - 21:28 ,"The gas war that Russia is waging against Europe is a form of terror, so it is necessary to hit back - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, The visit of the President of Guatemala to Kyiv took place today - the first in all the years of our independence. And the thing is not only that we received full support from this Latin American state, but also that our relations with it are a bridge to the entire region of Latin America., Ukrainian diplomacy is gradually opening up new broad directions for our society - Central and South America, Africa, countries of the Arab world, South and Southeast Asia., Unfortunately, there was not enough attention paid to these macro-regions. And this is tangible when it is necessary to accumulate support for Ukraine, in particular on international platforms., I am grateful to Guatemala and Mr. President Giammattei, with whom I held talks today, for the principled and consistent condemnation of Russian aggression and participation in the defense of the international legal order., Crises created by Russia affect everyone in the world, and no one will manage to stay aside when Russia provokes chaos in the food market, in the energy markets or simply in international relations., Following the negotiations, I am sure that Ukraine's position will be heard in Latin America. We agreed with Mr. President on the abolition of visa restrictions and the reboot of trade and economic relations between our countries., Today we saw another gas threat to Europe. Even despite the concession regarding the Nord Stream turbine, Russia is not going to resume gas supplies to European countries, as it is contractually obligated to do. All this is done by Russia deliberately to make it as difficult as possible for Europeans to prepare for winter. And this is an overt gas war that Russia is waging against a united Europe - this is exactly how it should be perceived. And they don't care what will happen to the people, how they will suffer - from hunger due to the blocking of ports or from winter cold and poverty... Or from occupation. These are just different forms of terror., And that's why it is necessary to hit back. Do not think about the way to return some turbine, but strengthen sanctions. Do everything to limit Russian revenues not only from gas and oil, but also from any remaining exports. And sever trade ties with Russia as much as possible, because every such tie is Russia’s potential tool of putting pressure., The gas blackmail of Europe, which only gets worse every month, is needed by a terrorist state to make life worse for every European. And this can actually be perceived as an incentive for the EU's eighth sanctions package to be significantly stronger than the recently approved seventh., I have adopted important personnel decisions today. In particular, Head of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine Kyrylo Budanov will also chair the Committee on Intelligence under the President of Ukraine. Combat General Viktor Khorenko has been appointed the new Commander of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And General Hryhoriy Halahan was transferred to another direction and, with the aim of updating the Security Service of Ukraine, was appointed the First Deputy Head of the Special Operations Center ""A"" of the Security Service of Ukraine., And separately, I would like to express gratitude today to our airborne assault troops, the Sicheslav brigade, which ""landed"" two Russian military aircraft and one helicopter - in a little more than one day. We must do everything to extend such a ""landing"" experience to all Russian aircraft and missile products in our skies., Eternal glory to all who fight for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
24 July 2022  - 22:02 ,The Day of Ukrainian Statehood on July 28 will assert the connection of many generations of our people - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, An important, symbolic week begins tomorrow. The week when we will first celebrate the Day of Ukrainian Statehood on July 28. For the first time., Celebrate at the time of such a brutal war - in the sixth month of it. After eight years of war in Donbas. But we will celebrate. Despite all. Because Ukrainians cannot be broken., The Day of Ukrainian Statehood will assert the connection of Ukrainians living now with many generations of our people. The state-building experience of Ukrainians, our culture, our identity, Ukrainian character are more than a thousand years old., Now, in many exploits of our warriors, in the wisdom of our people in battles, even simply in the conversations of ordinary Ukrainians about what is happening, we can see, we can hear and understand examples of the same characters but hundreds of years ago. We can see examples of the same bravery, the same attitude to life, and most importantly, the attitude towards Ukraine and the enemy., Only those who do not know the truth of history and do not feel its meaning could decide to attack us. After all that our people have gone through, after all that we have learned over the centuries. Ukrainians will never give up their independence. And they will not break from the inside as has happened more than once. Not this time!, Preserving unity now, working together for the victory is the most important national task that we all will definitely fulfill., And therefore, we will be able to do what previous generations could not do before. This applies to our defense in this war for independence, to our course towards a united Europe, towards full membership in the EU, and our ability to become one of the most modern states in the world., There is no one now who would doubt this. There are only those who argue about how to achieve this. It will happen. This is a sign of faith in Ukraine - not only our own faith., Even the occupiers admit that we will win. We hear it in their conversations – all the time, in what they tell their loved ones when they contact them., Therefore, we do not slow down and, as every day for five months, we are doing everything to inflict the greatest possible losses on the enemy and to gather as much support as possible for Ukraine., This week there will be important visits of partners, there will be important negotiations, and most importantly, there will be the further advancement of Ukrainian positions. At the front, in diplomacy, in the economy., I am grateful to everyone who defends our country!, And I wish all of us, all Ukrainians, a fruitful new week., Glory to Ukraine!"
23 July 2022  - 23:42 ,Armed Forces of Ukraine advancing step by step in Kherson region – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Dear Ukrainian men and women!, The one hundred and fiftieth day of our defense against Russia, against their invasion, is coming to an end. And this day is in some ways similar to all the previous ones – missile strikes again, heavy fighting in many areas of the front – Donbas, Kharkiv region, shelling again., But this day also shows how far we have come towards our victory. It will be!, First of all, we can say now about Kherson region. The occupiers tried to gain a foothold there, their collaborators made various brazen statements, which in Russian are called the very apt word ""shapkozakidatelstvo"" (false forecasts)... But how did it help them? The Armed Forces of Ukraine are advancing step by step in the region., Today's Russian missile attack on Odesa, on our port, is a cynical one, and it was also a blow to the political positions of Russia itself. If anyone in the world could still say that some kind of dialogue with it, with Russia, some kind of agreements are needed, see what is happening. Today's Russian Kalibr missiles have destroyed the very possibility for such statements., And we see the absolute unanimity of the world's reaction to this strike. The occupiers can no longer deceive anyone. Among other things, as a result of this strike, the building of the Odesa Art Museum was also damaged. The missiles hit very close to the historical objects of Odesa – something that is an asset not only for Ukrainian culture, but also for the culture of Europe., This apparent Russian barbarism brings us even closer to obtaining the very weapons we need for our victory., Today in the capital of Ukraine, I held talks with U.S. congressmen led by Adam Smith, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee., And we understand each other from half a word. And this also reflects the way we have passed during all these days – days of war., By the way, I want to thank the people of the United States, President Biden for the new $270 million security assistance package., I spoke today with the President of Kazakhstan, Mr. Tokayev. I thanked him for his fundamental support for Ukraine, our sovereignty, and international law. We discussed specific projects in the fields of energy, economy, digitalization., And, finally, today the second annual Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen took place in Kyiv. This year, it gathered even more participants. It united Kyiv with Warsaw, Brussels, London, and Washington. It united top politicians, public figures of other countries and our soldiers. Representatives of business, sports, media. Writers, show business stars, educators, doctors... In today's world, it is impossible to make do with the usual conventional diplomacy. We need soft power, we need the sincere desire of different societies to help the state, which is fighting for its indomitability and independence. And from this point of view, it has become very successful today., The initiative of the First Lady of Ukraine in two years actually became a traditional format – unique for the world community. Everyone recognizes the potential of soft power. But only Ukraine managed to direct its indomitability, its potential into concrete diplomatic practice., And in general, in these almost five months, we have achieved such large-scale and diplomatic support for Ukraine that Russia will not be able to oppose it., The day will come when missiles will lose their meaning for the occupiers. Now, it is possible to shoot down some of the missiles. The goal is to shoot down each one. And we will do everything necessary to still get modern and effective air defense systems. It's our goal., The terrorist state provides new arguments for this every day., As of today, almost 24,000 defenders of Ukraine have been given state awards for their bravery. A total of 160 soldiers were awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine. Millions of our people joined the defense of our state. And I am sincerely grateful to them, each of them., Our independence is our joint achievement. Victory will be shared. It will definitely be! I know it. I believe in it., Glory to Ukraine!"
23 July 2022  - 19:04 ,The war did not break Ukraine and will not break or stop life in our country – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the second Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen,", Dear First Ladies and Gentlemen!, Dear Ladies and gentlemen presidents!, Dear guests of the Summit!, Dear all our native Ukrainians!, I am extremely pleased to be here today, to participate with you in the opening of the second Kyiv Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen., Olena just said how important it is that during the war we keep up the pace of our activity and do not give in to the circumstances., 150 days. After eight years. The war did not break Ukraine and will not break it, did not stop life in our country and will not stop it. And it will definitely not make us hostages of the terror that the invaders brought to our beautiful, peaceful and strong state., The main topic of this Summit is the post-war recovery of Ukraine, the human dimension of this recovery., Why are we talking about reconstruction now, when the war is not yet over? So that on the first day of peace you can feel it fully. So that there was already a systematic reconstruction of everything that was destroyed by the Russian army. So that there are already security guarantees for our people. So that people already know where and how they can return if they went abroad to escape hostilities. So that the medical system restores its strong capacity. So that parents do not have any unanswered questions about education, first of all for their children. So that people know for sure that there are jobs for them in Ukraine and there is a choice of how to express themselves. And that all our respectable men and women veterans, who have gone through the hell of battles, really feel the gratitude of our state., I just met at Bankova Street with the congressmen of the United States of America, who came to support us and you, all Ukrainians, in the fight for the main thing – for freedom., The delegation was led by Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Adam Smith., And it was felt that our conversation about the further increase of aid was a continuation of all our previous talks and, in particular, the meetings of the First Lady of Ukraine in Washington., We see that the address of the First Lady of Ukraine in the U.S. Congress was also heard – there is activity both regarding weapons for Ukraine and regarding the legal response to what Russia is doing against our independence and our state., Today, this important Summit will contribute to the protection of the state and overcoming the consequences of Russian terrorist attacks., We are harnessing the power of our society and seeing results., Ukraine has the largest global support in its history - our anti-war coalition includes dozens of countries: from Canada to New Zealand, from Japan and the United States to the UK and every friendly country in Europe., We have established the kind of connections with our partners that allow us already five months to oppose an army that has been building for the purpose of our destruction for decades., We are building new relations with many countries of the world. Contacts with the countries of Africa and Latin America were intensified only during these months. Many of them are at this level for the first time: Guatemala, Ecuador, Paraguay, Costa Rica, Mozambique, Cote d'Ivoire, etc., The President of Indonesia – one of the largest Islamic countries in the world and the leader in ASEAN – visited Kyiv for the first time., Ukraine participated three times in the G7 meetings, we have an invitation to the G20 summit., We started a new form of diplomatic activity – systematic and large-scale appeals to the parliaments and peoples of the world. And they showed that it can be more powerful than all other forms of conventional diplomacy., We also launched a fundamentally new public charity platform, UNITED24, which helps to unite the potential of different societies, civic activism on different continents of the world, efforts of business and the cultural sphere to implement specific projects for the protection and restoration of our state, which we now very much need., Outstanding people have already become Ambassadors for the UNITED24 platform, outstanding athletes Andriy Shevchenko and Elina Svitolina, actor Liev Schreiber, and now it is also the Imagine Dragons band – I spoke with them last night., Over UAH 5 billion have already been raised during the existence of our charity platform., We achieved such a result in relations with the European Union, which seemed to many to be a fantasy, when we here in Kyiv, on the fifth day of the war, signed the application for joining the EU., And now for people it is just a part of the usual reality – the fact that Ukraine is officially recognized as an EU candidate., And I believe that peace in Ukraine, and the reconstruction of our country, and the return of our beautiful people from abroad, and the further movement of our state into a united Europe will become equally common facts., Is this possible? We all don't just feel, we know that all these things are possible. And it will be so!, Otherwise, this second Summit in particular would not have happened. There wouldn't be all its participants and there wouldn't be this attention that I see now., Because this is attention to the future of our Ukraine, which we will make together, which we will build despite everything, despite the war. I am sure that today in the addresses and discussions, talks at the panels of the Summit, we will be able to hear a lot of very important, useful things. This is the Summit of those whose power, though soft, is always invincible., I thank you all for participating! I thank our friends, close friends from Latvia, Lithuania, from all continents of the world, who will join us today., Thank you all!, Glory to Ukraine!"
22 July 2022  - 22:28 ,Russia did everything to destroy Ukraine's export potential; we didn't allow it – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Dear Ukrainian men and women!, Dear all our defenders, Today, our state and the entire civilized world have reached an important agreement – we have an agreement that allows us to unblock Ukrainian ports and restore Ukrainian agricultural exports., From the first day of the full-scale invasion, Russia did everything to not just close Ukraine's access to the sea, but to destroy the very potential of our exports – port infrastructure, our railways, warehouses and silos. We did not allow it., And now we can not only restore the operation of our ports on the Black Sea, but also keep them protected. This has been worked out with our military and with our intelligence. The military assured me of one hundred percent control of the approaches to our ports., For a long time, all the details of the initiative signed today in Istanbul were discussed with our key international partners and the United Nations. Many leaders were involved in helping to restore our exports by sea. And I am grateful to UN Secretary-General António Guterres and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for their efforts., The text of the document signed today is published, and everyone can read its points. They fully meet the interests of Ukraine., First. About 20 million tonnes of last year's grain harvest will be exported. And also it will be possible to sell this year's harvest – and it is already being harvested. These are the incomes of farmers, the entire agricultural sector and the state budget. These are jobs. These are funds for next year's sowing season., We now have approximately $10 billion worth of grain., Secondly. Finally, there is a chance to reduce the severity of the food crisis provoked by Russia. There is a chance to prevent a global catastrophe – a famine that could lead to political chaos in many countries of the world, in particular in the countries that help us., And the thirdly. This is another illustration that Ukraine is able to withstand this war. It is important that everything in the territorial waters of Ukraine will be controlled by our state., And it is clear to everyone that there may be some provocations on the part of Russia, some attempts to discredit Ukrainian and international efforts. But we trust the UN. Now, it is their responsibility and responsibility of international partners to ensure compliance with the agreements., And I want to thank all our soldiers who cleared Snake Island from the enemy, defend Odesa and Mykolaiv, gradually advance in Kherson region, liberating our territory. I'm thankful to all of you who proves every day: Russia will not win this war., We are preparing for the start of the second Kyiv Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen tomorrow. This initiative of the First Lady of Ukraine was founded last year and proved that it can turn the soft power of the wives and husbands of the leaders of the states to solving various problems of national and global scale., This year's summit will be devoted to the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. And it's not just about reconstruction. It is about the return of people, that is, about displaced people who should not become refugees. About all the necessary help and rehabilitation for those who suffered from the war. And about the revival of social life in communities and cities that were destroyed by the occupiers., In particular, within the framework of the Summit and on the basis of our public charity platform United24, fundraising for specialized ambulances for Ukraine has already begun., I won't reveal everything prepared by the First Lady of Ukraine and her team, but I feel that it will be a powerful event from a diplomatic point of view., I spoke today with a great friend of Ukraine, Boris Johnson. First of all, about security and defense cooperation. We are waiting for a new package of military support., Relations between Ukraine and the UK are built on common values. And no matter what happens in politics, the ties between our countries and societies will only strengthen., In the evening, I signed another decree on awarding our soldiers. 180 combatants were given state awards, 100 of them posthumously., Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for the independence of Ukraine!, Eternal glory to all who fight for our country!, Glory to Ukraine!

21 July 2022  - 22:25 ,We have a significant potential for the advance of our forces on the front and for the infliction of significant losses on the occupiers - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today, I held a regular meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief - this format of our work brings together key leaders of the defense and security sectors., We listened to the reports of Head of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine Kyrylo Budanov, Head of the Foreign Intelligence Service Oleksandr Lytvynenko, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhny, Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, as well as Minister of Internal Affairs Denys Monastyrskyi., Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrskyi, Commander of the Land Forces, joined the Staff meeting directly from the frontline., We discussed the current situation on the frontline, around Ukraine. We defined tasks in some tactical areas to strengthen our positions. And we also thoroughly worked out the issue of providing the troops with the modern weapons - the intensity of attacks on the enemy still needs to be increased., The participants of the Staff meeting agreed that we have a significant potential for the advance of our forces on the front and for the infliction of significant new losses on the occupiers., Today, Head of my Office Andriy Yermak and General Zaluzhny had another conversation with US President's National Security Advisor Jacob Sullivan and United States Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley., In this two-on-two format, all key issues of cooperation in the defense sphere between Ukraine and the United States are constantly discussed., I held negotiations with the President of Costa Rica - for the first time in the history of relations between our states. I thanked him for his support of Ukraine - it is felt, for countering Russian propaganda and the introduction of sanctions., And I will continue to do everything possible so that the truth about Russia's actions against Ukraine is known in every part of the world. Our diplomacy is constantly creating new ties with countries that have not been the focus of Ukrainian foreign policy for a long time., And tomorrow we also expect news for our state from Turkey - regarding the unblocking of our ports., Against the background of such regular military-political and diplomatic activity, it was a little strange to hear today an old-new fake of Russian propaganda about me. That I am allegedly in an intensive care unit, that Ruslan Stefanchuk is allegedly performing the duties of the head of state., Well, what can I say... Earlier, almost every week, Russian propagandists and officials spreaded fakes that I allegedly fled somewhere from Ukraine or that I allegedly did not fulfill my duties. Then it all stopped. And here such primitive things are thrown in again. It seems that the occupiers are even running out of ammunition of lies - they are unable to come up with anything new., The existing potential for all forms of Russian aggression will certainly be exhausted as well, including for offensive actions on the front and terror against our cities., We will do everything to speed it up. And this is exactly what we emphasize in all contacts with our partners., Today, the Russian army again shelled the Saltivka district of Kharkiv with rocket artillery - purely civilian objects. Residential building, trade pavilions, public transport. As of this time, three people are known to have died, and more than twenty people are on the list of wounded., The occupiers also fired at the Slovyansk community in Donbas with ""Uragans"" and hit Kramatorsk with ""Iskanders""., And each of these Russian strikes is an argument for Ukraine to receive more HIMARS and other modern and effective weapons. Each of these shelling occasions only strengthens our desire to defeat the occupiers - it will certainly happen., A few months ago, our expert group chaired by Yermak and McFaul suggested recognizing Russia's actions against Ukraine as genocide. And here is the first real result of the visit of the First Lady of Ukraine to the United States - Senators Risch, Cardin, Wicker, Blumenthal, Portman, Shaheen and Graham presented a draft resolution on recognition of Russia's actions in Ukraine as genocide., The resolution states that Russia's actions in Ukraine, which include forced deportation to Russia and the targeted killing of Ukrainian civilians during mass atrocities, are genocide against the people of Ukraine. The senators introduced the resolution shortly after Olena delivered an address directly to the US Congress., According to the draft document, the US Senate condemns Russia for committing acts of genocide against the people of Ukraine; calls on the United States, together with NATO and EU allies, to support the government of Ukraine to prevent further acts of Russian genocide against the Ukrainian people; supports tribunals and international criminal investigations to hold Russian political leaders and military personnel accountable for war of aggression, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide., With all its terrorist attacks against Ukrainians and our country, Russia is only burying itself., In the evening, I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 186 combatants were awarded state awards., Eternal gratitude to all who fight for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
20 July 2022  - 22:06 ,The representatives of Ukraine did not stop working for a single day to obtain an effective air defense system - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Ukrainians!, All our defenders!, I'm sure you've seen how effective the weapons provided by the partners are, especially modern MLRS. The name HIMARS has become almost native to our people - just like Javelin or NLAW, like ""Stugna"" or ""Neptune"" earlier., And it is obvious that the next equally important name will appear from modern air defense systems, which we are requesting from partners. The representatives of our state did not stop working for a single day to obtain an effective air defense system. And we have certain agreements on this, there is certain success that allows us to destroy part of the missiles, but a completely different speed and scale of protection is required., But everything depends, unfortunately, not on us, but on political decisions that can be made in key capitals. And that is why this topic of air defense became key today in the speech of the First Lady of Ukraine in the Congress of the United States of America. It was the first time in history that the First Lady made such an address to the Congress, and it is certainly an honor for Ukraine, for all our people., The speech was as practical and sincere as possible - actually on behalf of all our families. Olena spoke about the victims of Russian terror and about the real opportunity for our American friends to help us stop this terror. This can be our joint victory - of the Ukrainian and American nations., I am hopeful that the answers to our requests will be provided shortly. Russian terror must lose., Today, I discussed the issue of increasing pressure on Russia for the war and additional support for Ukraine during a meeting with the Foreign Ministers of Austria and the Czech Republic who visited Kyiv. I thanked both countries for the assistance already provided and outlined the needs for the near future., The Czech Republic holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, and it is therefore important that the Czech leadership retains all available power. During these six months, we must take basic steps to prepare for the beginning of negotiations regarding Ukraine's membership in the EU., I also spoke with President of the European Council Charles Michel. Financial support for Ukraine is among the main topics. We are preparing for the next Ukraine-EU Summit, as well as for the institutional strengthening of our state on the path to the European Union. Soon there may be important news in this regard - we are preparing some historic decisions for our participation in the life of a united Europe., The seventh sanctions package of the European Union is in the final stage of approval. Its elements have already been announced, including a ban on the import of Russian gold. But this is not enough, and I frankly tell my partners about it. Russia must feel a much higher price for the war so that it forces it to seek peace., And now it is worth looking at what is happening on the European energy market. We see how erroneous the policy of some old leaders of European countries, who made Europe hostage to gas supplies from Russia, was. And while the EU does not dare include gas in the sanctions packages, Russia uses gas for its own sanctions against every European family, literally hitting the family budgets of Europeans with pressure on the energy markets., Ukraine has always said that Russia cannot be considered a reliable supplier of gas. And if our position had been listened to earlier, there would be no need now to look for emergency ways to fill the deficit that Russia is artificially creating on the European market., When we turn to our partners with this or that request, with this or that advice or demand, it is based on the experience of Ukraine - on what we have already experienced. Russia is testing in Ukraine everything that can be used against other European countries. It started with gas wars and ended with a full-scale invasion, missile terror and burned cities of Ukraine. And so that this does not happen to anyone else, we must ensure a tangible joint victory over Russia in Ukraine. The sooner this is done, the less damage and suffering will be experienced by all European families, all European countries., Therefore, after the approval of the seventh package of sanctions, it will be necessary to immediately start working on the eighth. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the supply of modern weapons to Ukraine, to provide our state with effective air defense., We will do everything so that our partners have this understanding and for it to never weaken., I am grateful to everyone who helps Ukrainians on the way to victory!, I am grateful to everyone who defends our country!, Glory to Ukraine!"
19 July 2022  - 22:59 ,"No matter how the occupiers try to hide, the Armed Forces and our intelligence will ensure retaliatory strikes, and every Russian criminal will be identified - address by the President of Ukraine",", Ukrainians!, All our defenders!, Every day, the occupiers give new reasons for recognizing Russia as a terrorist state. Last night, they carried out a missile attack on a village in the Odesa region - 7 sea-based ""Kalibr"" missiles against an ordinary village. These are not cheap or simple missiles - Russia was very proud of them. And what did they hit? An ordinary rural field and a non-working farm, rural houses, outbuildings, a lyceum, a cultural center. No military sense. Just terror., Fortunately, there were no casualties - people reacted in time to the air-raid warning signal. But six locals were injured, including a 5-month-old child. She and her mother are given all the necessary aid. These are the targets of Russian cruise missiles. And what kind of wimp do you have to be to fulfill commands for such missile strikes at peaceful villages and cities? Even fish and rapana in the Black Sea have more dignity than the officers of the Russian fleet., Over the past day, the targets for Russian shelling were also Nikopol and other settlements of the Dnipropetrovsk region, the Kharkiv region, Mykolaiv, Kramatorsk - a cruise missile hit the center of the city, Slovyansk, Toretsk and other cities of Donbas. Many casualties, many wounded... The occupiers shelled the border areas of the Sumy region. At the captured Zaporizhzhia NPP and in Enerhodar there are new facts of terror against workers and local residents... No matter how the occupiers try to hide, the Armed Forces of Ukraine and our intelligence will ensure retaliatory strikes and our state will identify every Russian criminal who is guilty in the terror of Ukrainians., Increasing American support for Ukraine, additional assistance to protect people from Russian terror, addressing humanitarian needs are all the tasks of the ongoing visit of the First Lady of Ukraine to the United States. Today, on the second day of the visit, a meeting at the White House with First Lady Jill Biden took place - President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband came to greet the First Lady of Ukraine. I am grateful to the presidential couple of the United States, all representatives of the American Administration and every American family for their warmth towards our country and our people., And I expect from this visit of the First Lady significant results for Ukraine in cooperation with America. It is important right now. There have already been meetings with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, with Samantha Power and other influential female politicians representing the government and parliamentary structures of America. Tomorrow Olena will speak in the Congress - on behalf of all Ukrainian mothers, all Ukrainian women, and it will be an important address. And I really believe that it will be heard by those on whom decision-making in the US depends., Today I had phone conversations with three leaders. I informed President of Poland Andrzej Duda about the situation on the frontline. We discussed further steps in countering Russian aggression. I spoke with Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi. I thanked him for his honest and principled position in defense of our common European values. In the evening, I also spoke with the President of Côte d'Ivoire. I informed him about our efforts to counter the food crisis, which was created by Russia and which threatens the world with large-scale hunger., The renewal of the power vertical of the state is in progress. Today I appointed new heads of regional offices of the Security Service of Ukraine in the Zakarpattia, Poltava, Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv regions. I also dismissed one of the deputy heads of the Security Service of Ukraine., I am grateful to the members of the competition commission on the election of the head of the Specialized Anticorruption Prosecutor's Office for finalizing the competition. The decision on the winner has been approved., A new Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine - Oksana Zholnovych - was appointed as well. I expect her to be more active in explaining to people all the nuances of state social policy - specific people's rights, payment mechanisms and other opportunities provided by the state. It is also necessary to speed up the modernization of the regulatory framework for social policy, and the role of the minister in this should be significant., It is very important that today the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine implemented the initiative of Head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak to set up a special commission to control the use of weapons provided by our partners. The commission included representatives of all parliamentary factions and groups., I want to emphasize: there is no ground for any claims to our state in this regard. Our partners are fully informed about how we use the weapons provided. But in order to put an end to any manipulations of Russian propagandists and those who help them in Ukraine or somewhere else, such an additional parliamentary control tool will enter into force., I signed another decree on awarding our warriors. 185 servicemen were awarded state awards, five of them posthumously., Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine!, Glory to all who defend and strengthen our state!, Glory to Ukraine!"
18 July 2022  - 22:37 ,"Provide information and emotional support to our people in the occupied areas, tell them about Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today, a photo of a guy from Mariupol, who went out to the streets of the city with a Ukrainian flag, went viral. He came to the remains of the drama theater building destroyed by Russian troops. This was very brave. And I want to thank him for this act., This guy is one of many of our people who are waiting for the return of Ukraine and who will not accept the occupation under any circumstances., Russia keeps most of them in an information vacuum. Every day in the occupied territories it spreads new lies about Ukraine and our actions. But despite propaganda and intimidation, people not only remember Ukraine, but also demonstrate what they really think and what they strive for., We never forgot about them. And I ask all of you who have contacts and opportunities for this: spread real information to the occupied territory, support our people, spread the truth there. In any way you find effective. On our entire Ukrainian land from Kherson to Horlivka, from Henichesk to the occupied districts of the Kharkiv region, in Melitopol and Berdyansk, in Enerhodar, in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, in Crimea, our people should hear about Ukraine from Ukrainians., The Armed Forces of our state managed to inflict significant logistical losses on the invaders. It is increasingly difficult for the Russian army to hold positions on the captured territory. Step by step, we advance, disrupt supplies for the occupiers, identify and neutralize collaborators., The prospect is obvious: the Ukrainian flag will be in all our cities and villages. The only question is time. And while this time lasts, while Russia can still destroy life in Ukraine, as it did today with strikes at Nikopol, Toretsk, cities in the Kharkiv region, do not forget to provide information and emotional support to our people in the occupied areas. Tell them about Ukraine. For its part, the state does this. But we must use all the information power of our society., As of today, 1,028 settlements were liberated from the occupiers. Another 2,621 are still under the control of the invaders. And we must maintain information communication with all of them - with all where there are people. As much as possible., I spoke today with President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro about the long-term consequences of the Russian war against Ukraine, the sanctions policy, and the issue of our bilateral relations., And one more important news regarding the Security Service of Ukraine. Personnel audit of the Service is taking place. The issue of dismissal of 28 officials is being considered. Different levels, different directions. But the grounds are similar - unsatisfactory job performance., I am thankful to everyone who faithfully and effectively serves the state!, I am thankful to everyone who defends Ukrainian interests at their level., Glory to Ukraine!"
17 July 2022  - 22:30 ,Actions and inaction of every official in the security sector and in the law enforcement agencies will be evaluated - address by the President of Ukraine,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today I was informed of the results of another operation against criminals who worked for the enemy., Employees of the State Bureau of Investigation together with the Security Service of Ukraine detained the former head of the Main Directorate of the Security Service of Ukraine in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. This person was dismissed by me at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, and as we can see, that decision was completely justified. Sufficient evidence has been collected to notify this person of suspicion of treason. All his criminal activities are documented. Everything he has done during these months as well as earlier will get a proper legal assessment., Everyone who together with him was part of a criminal group that worked in the interests of the Russian Federation will also be held accountable. It is about the transfer of secret information to the enemy and other facts of cooperation with the Russian special services., I want to thank everyone who participated in this operation. It can truly be called self-purification., I visited the frontline regions - the most difficult ones. I personally dealt with the activities of the law enforcement agencies in particular. As a result of this, as you already know, personnel decisions were made regarding the regional heads of the security sector - Kherson, Kharkiv. We also sorted out the issues of the local leadership of the executive power., The specific actions and any inaction of each official in the security sector and in law enforcement agencies will be evaluated. The corresponding inspection of law enforcement agencies has already yielded the first results and will be continued., As of today, 651 criminal proceedings have been registered regarding treason and collaboration activities of employees of prosecutor's offices, pretrial investigation bodies, and other law enforcement agencies. In 198 criminal proceedings, relevant persons were notified of suspicion. In particular, more than 60 employees of the prosecutor's office and the Security Service of Ukraine remained in the occupied territory and are working against our state., Such an array of crimes against the foundations of the national security of the state and the connections detected between the employees of the security forces of Ukraine and the special services of Russia pose very serious questions to the relevant leadership. Each of these questions will receive a proper answer. Today I made a decision to suspend the Prosecutor General from office and the Head of the Security Service of Ukraine from discharging duties., I want to be heard today by everyone on whom the extremely sensitive issue of appointing a new head of the Specialized Anticorruption Prosecutor's Office depends., My position as the President of Ukraine is that the competition that took place should lead to a completely logical decision on the appointment of a new head. The appropriate person was selected, and the finalization of this decision depends on the competition commission., Why is this issue sensitive? The answer is obvious. Without a full-fledged head of such an institution, its full--fledged functioning is impossible. By the way, the same applies to the National Anticorruption Bureau of Ukraine. The term of office of the previous head has ended. And there should be a competition procedure for the selection of a new head of NABU. I instructed the Prime Minister of Ukraine to intensify the process of launching the relevant competition., I know that the employees of the anticorruption infrastructure perform their duties at this time and in such conditions. Moreover, they participate in the defense of our state. In particular, seven NABU employees received state awards after February 24., However, the full functionality of any state body can be used only when there is an effective leader. So, this competition is also extremely important., Today, another not-too-sober statement about the alleged ""doomsday"" for Ukraine was heard from Russia. Of course, no one will perceive such intimidation. But look how cynical it is to say such a thing today - on the anniversary of Russia's shooting down of the Malaysian Boeing in the sky over the Ukrainian Donbas. 298 people were killed in an obvious act of terrorism. 80 children. Citizens of ten states., Already then, Russia was following this path - to the status of a terrorist state and to a special tribunal, which will definitely take place regarding Russian aggression against Ukraine. This will be a doomsday for Russia. And not in a figurative sense, not as a loud saying, but literally., As of 19:00 today, Russia has already used more than three thousand cruise missiles against Ukraine. It is impossible to count the number of artillery and other projectiles that were used against our country and our people. But it is definitely possible to bring all Russian war criminals to justice. Each of the collaborators. All those responsible for terror. For everything that happens during 144 days and in more than eight years. It will be done., I spoke today with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. Of course, we discussed our cooperation and I thanked him, I thanked Canada for its support., But I separately emphasized that Ukrainians will never accept Canada's decision regarding the Nord Stream turbine, which was decided to be handed over to Germany in violation of the sanctions regime., This issue is not just about the turbine. This is a matter of compliance with sanctions. If there is one violation now, it is only a matter of time before there will be others. Russia deliberately does this blackmailing with gas and provoking violations of sanctions., There are enough routes for the transit of Russian gas to Europe. And every country must maintain principles., I am grateful to everyone who fights and defends justice., I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine., Glory to Ukraine!"
16 July 2022  - 21:59 ,"Russia's missiles, artillery not to be able to break our unity, to throw us off our path – address of President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians! Ukrainian men and women!, On this day, 32 years ago, the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine was endorsed. It was the first document of this kind after many years, which confirmed the right of our people to live independently. Independently and in a democratic way. The specific points of the Declaration reflected the realities of that time and the hopes that prevailed in our society. 32 years later, after eight years of war in Donbas and on the 143rd day of the full-scale war against Russia, it may seem that the text of the Declaration could be different, particularly from a security point of view. But at that time this text was also of a revolutionary character. The Declaration restored the tradition of Ukrainian state-establishing, and it was on its basis that the Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine was later adopted. And today, when our people are fighting for independence, we have our right in every sense of the word – historically, politically, culturally and, what is very important – legally. In particular, our people's confidence in victory is based on this., Ukraine has withstood Russia's brutal blows. We have already managed to liberate part of the territory that was occupied after February 24. We will gradually liberate other regions of our state that are currently under the occupation. During such a war, we were able to obtain the status of the EU candidate. We have maintained the stability of public institutions. The power system was rebuilt to work in the power grid of the European continent. All logistical processes in the state – military and economic – were rechanneled. And most importantly, we maintain internal unity, having overcome conflicts and contradictions that had hindered us in the past., We must all remember the cost of mistakes and discord that made it difficult for previous generations to achieve the results we have today. We must remember how much our people had to go through until it became possible to restore Ukraine's sovereignty and independence. But our time has added one more thing to everything that path strewn teaches. It's very important. This did not happen before. Never in the past, as much as now, it did not depend on the ability of Ukrainians to be very careful and circumspect in the information field. Even today showed how important it is that we take care of Ukraine and each other in what we say and how we experience this time. How many people were scared today by a fake about a massive Russian missile attack on Ukraine? After everything that happened in the previous weeks. After the Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Chasiv Yar... How many headaches are given every day by the production of horror stories from Russian propagandists and officials... How many problems Ukrainians create for themselves by trusting any anonymous source... This sometimes takes on simply unhealthy forms when social networks and websites deliberately stuff fake information from Russia, the purpose of which is only one – to add media terror to the missile and artillery terror against our country., Therefore, we also need a kind of emotional sovereignty so that we do not depend on what the enemy constantly launches against you and me. In order not to play along with the media game against Ukraine. To have the power to consciously perceive any information, any messages, no matter who they come from. And to see who needs them and for what, and whether Ukraine needs them in particular, whether they make the path to victory easier for you and me., Sometimes media weapons can do more than conventional weapons. It is obvious that any missiles and artillery of Russia will not succeed in breaking our unity and knocking us off our path. And it should be equally obvious that Ukrainian unity cannot be broken by lies or intimidation, fake information or conspiracy theories., We will stand. We will win. We will win back our, rebuild our lives. We will do it together – that's the only way it can be done. This can be done only without mutual competition. This is our obligation to all generations of our people who fought for our freedom and sovereignty of Ukraine., I am grateful to everyone who is fighting for the state of Ukraine, who is working for victory and who is defending our people., Let's hold on. Only together! Glory to Ukraine!"
15 July 2022  - 23:19 ,"We will come to the day when Russian terror will become impossible, but for this we still need to fight – address of President of Ukraine",", Ukrainians! Ukrainian men and women!, Today, the European Union announced the first details of the new, seventh sanctions package being prepared against the Russian Federation, and the task of Ukrainian diplomats is to do everything to strengthen this package., After an attack on Vinnytsia and other terrorist attacks by the Russian army, the occupiers must feel what a fair response to terror means. In particular, it will be felt thanks to sanctions. Of course, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will certainly provide their part of the answer. The occupiers will have no restful nights., The identification of all those guilty in the attack on the city of Vinnytsia has already begun. Both at the national level and at the international level, we will do everything to make absolutely all Russian murderers responsible for what they have done., The Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine reported to me today full information about the rescue operation that was run in the city. In total, almost two hundred people applied for medical help. Four people are currently in critical condition, unfortunately. Four citizens are still missing in the list. Everything is being done on the ground to clarify their fate. The death toll has not changed at this time – 23 people., The minister also briefed me on the attack of the Russian army on the city of Mykolaiv this morning. The buildings of two institutes – pedagogical and shipbuilding – have been destroyed., There are no such words in normal human language that can describe the state to which the Russian state has degraded. It is a double crime – to destroy particularly pedagogical institutes, so that there is no educational institution, and new educators cannot be trained..., But let the terrorists not hope that this will give them something. We will definitely restore everything they destroyed. Each of the more than two thousand educational institutions – all kindergartens, all schools, institutes, universities. And most importantly, we will preserve our humanity and our civility. But Russian society with so many murderers and executioners will remain crippled for generations, and through its own fault., The United States of America is preparing a defense budget for the new fiscal year - with supplemental assistance to Ukraine. In particular, it is about expanding the capabilities of our military aviation. This and other US assistance to our country will significantly strengthen our defense potential. It is important., I want to once again express my gratitude to the American people, President Biden, the US Congress for all the support we receive. By the way, only in the last two weeks, $3 billion were transferred to the Ukrainian budget from the United States of America, and this enables us to ensure the current social needs of Ukrainians today. America is truly a leader in the global defense of freedom., Right now, as I am writing this address, the air alert is over almost the entire territory of our state. There is preliminary information about strikes - Dnipro, Kremenchuk, Kyiv region. The occupiers realize that we are gradually becoming stronger, and the goal of their terror is very simple – to put pressure on you and me, on our society, to intimidate people, to cause as much as possible damage to Ukrainian cities, while Russian terrorists are still able to do it., So I'm begging you, once again: please don't ignore the air alert signals now. Appropriate rules of conduct must be followed at all times, especially at public objects. Of course, we will come to the day when Russian terror will become impossible. But it still needs time. We still have to fight. And we will fight., Today, I signed a new decree on awarding our soldiers. A total of 242 combatants were honored by state awards., Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for you and me, for Ukraine!, Eternal gratitude to all who defend our state!, Glory to Ukraine!"
14 July 2022  - 22:50 ,This day once again proved that Russia must be recognized as a terrorist state - address by the President of Ukraine,", Today I am addressing not Ukrainian men and women, as usual, but our partners. Democratic world., This day once again proved that Russia must be officially recognized as a terrorist state. No other state in the world poses such a terrorist threat as Russia. No other state in the world allows itself to destroy peaceful cities and ordinary human life with cruise missiles and rocket artillery every day., As a result of just one missile attack on our city of Vinnytsia, 23 people were killed. Three children under the age of ten. And this, unfortunately, is not yet the final number. Debris clearance is ongoing. Dozens of people are listed as missing. Heavily wounded are among those hospitalized., One of the missiles destroyed the Neuromed medical center. There were people inside. Nataliya, she is 40 years old. Tetiana, she is 32 years old. Volodymyr, he is 61 years old. Vira, she is 55 years old. I saw them among the missing. You see, it was not even known what happened to the people who simply went to the medical center..., And if someone launched a missile attack on a medical center in Dallas or Dresden, God forbid, what would it be called? Wouldn’t it be called terrorism?, A girl is among the dead today in Vinnytsia, she was four years old, her name was Liza. The child was four years old! Her mother is in critical condition..., Russia ended the girl's life just at the time when a conference on Russian war crimes was taking place in the Netherlands, in The Hague. A conference where it was decided what should be done to ensure that every Russian military is punished., Can you think of any other terrorist organization that would allow itself such audacity? To kill just at the moment when its previous crimes are the subject of international discussion., Russia has thus shown its attitude to international law, to Europe, and to the entire civilized world. After that, no one can have any doubt that a Special Tribunal on Russian aggression against Ukraine is needed as soon as possible. Also, a special compensation mechanism must be implemented as soon as possible, with the help of which all Russian assets and funds in all countries of the world must be confiscated and aimed at compensations for the victims of Russian terror., It is absolutely necessary to implement as soon as possible such restrictions against Russian energy exports, which will not allow terrorists to cover their costs at the expense of the international community., And I want to emphasize: all this is needed not only by Ukraine, not only by our citizens, whose lives are under threat of Russian terror. This is needed by all of you, everyone in the world who values human life at least a little., Terror is a virus. And if one of the terrorists goes unpunished, it only encourages others., The ceremony of awarding our defenders upon whom the title of Hero of Ukraine was conferred took place this morning in Kyiv. I presented the Gold Star Orders to our warriors, as well as to the relatives of those warriors who were awarded the title of Hero posthumously., In total, during the full-scale war since February 24, the title of Hero has been awarded to 157 Ukrainians, 75 - posthumously. More than 23,000 of our defenders have been awarded state awards, more than 3,500 - posthumously., Hundreds of thousands of our warriors hold back the Russian onslaught every day and every night. Ukrainians make one of the most significant contributions in history to the the fight against terrorism. And we are grateful to everyone who helps us. To every state, international structures, public associations around the world, conscientious business, every person who cares., But the time has come for the democratic world to enshrine all this in proper legal instruments. The status of a terrorist state for Russia. The special tribunal on Russian aggression. The special compensation mechanism that will direct the funds of the terrorist state to those whom it wanted to destroy. And, of course, new sanctions for terror. New sanctions are needed as soon as possible., And finally. I want the crew of the vessel, which fired the Kalibrs on Vinnytsia today, to know for sure that prison is the best thing they may face., Eternal memory to all victims of Russian terror!, Eternal glory to each and every one who defends a normal peaceful life!, Glory to Ukraine!"
14 July 2022  - 17:11 ,All Russian criminals must face a mandatory and principled punishment - President's speech at the International Conference in The Hague on holding Russia accountable for crimes in Ukraine ,", Dear conference participants,, Ladies and Gentlemen!, I am grateful for this opportunity to address you and take part in a conference whose purpose, frankly speaking, is to save international law. Because right now it depends precisely on our joint efforts whether humanity will have such a tool as international law at all. Whether humanity will live in chaos and constant violence from those who believe that force allegedly decides everything and that aggression allegedly allows any wishes of tyrants to be served under the guise of law., In a few days, on July 17, it will already be 8 years since one of the most terrible air disasters in history - shooting down of MH17 flight. Then, Russian criminals killed 298 people in the sky over the Ukrainian Donbas. The world, seeing that crime, realized what is happening in Ukraine. Realized what aggression Russia came with to our country., The shooting down of MH17 attracted global attention. All the world's media, politicians and societies felt the pain of the families who lost their loved ones in that disaster. 80 children died, among them three babies... It is impossible to forget the photos of children's toys found on the ground among the wreckage of the Boeing., Time passes by, that tragedy is talked about less and less. But justice does its job. Ukraine, the Netherlands, all our partners, experts and investigators managed to establish a complete picture of what happened to MH17. And I have no doubt that everyone who committed that terrible crime will receive a fair punishment., However, we must remember why that crime became possible. We must remember that it is neither the only one nor random. That catastrophe became just one of many catastrophes and tragedies caused by the primary Russian crime – armed aggression against Ukraine. It all started in 2014. And it continues to this day. Taking the lives of our people every day., This morning, Russian missiles hit our city of Vinnytsia. An ordinary peaceful city. Cruise missiles hit two public buildings. Residential buildings were destroyed, the medical center was on fire. Cars and trams were on fire. This is an audacious act of Russian terror. People couldn't do that. They are beasts! Eight missiles, two of which hit downtown. As of this moment, 20 people died, among them three children, a large number of wounded..., I ask you now to honor with a moment of silence the memory of all those killed by Russian crimes - from 2014 to this day, all those who were killed by Russia on our Ukrainian land and in the Ukrainian sky., Thank you. I am grateful to you for honoring the memory of the victims of Russian aggression with me. Just feel it: we do it every day. Because every day, every day, our people die, children die. Due to Russian aggression, tens of thousands of Ukrainians were killed, tortured and maimed. Millions were deported to Russia or made homeless by hostilities. It is still being established how many children Russian forces abducted and took out of Ukraine... The preliminary figure is dreadful - about two hundred thousand children., The world saw what happened in Mariupol and Bucha. The world sees Russian missile terror. Literally live, everyone can see Russian artillery burning down cities in Donbas and destroying civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv and in the south of our country. Only since the start of the full-scale invasion on February 24, the law enforcement agencies of Ukraine have registered 34 thousand 39 crimes related to Russian aggression. This is slightly less than in 5 months. And imagine how many crimes the Russian occupiers have committed since 2014..., And for this primary, initial crime of armed aggression, there must be mandatory and principled punishment for all Russian criminals., Ukrainian justice will do the part of the work that the national jurisdiction allows. I believe that the International Criminal Court will inevitably ensure the liability of those guilty of crimes under its jurisdiction: war crimes, crimes against humanity, the crime of genocide. And I am grateful to all our partners who support us along the way., By the way, to help the investigation - both Ukrainian and international - we launched the ""Book of Torturers of the Ukrainian People"" project. This project allows you to collect evidence of war crimes and data about those who committed them on an online platform. In today's world, this and similar digital and communication tools significantly accelerate the work of the investigation., But the existing judicial institutions for jurisdictional reasons cannot bring to justice all those guilty of the primary crime of aggression. That is why we need a Special Tribunal regarding this crime - Russian aggression against Ukraine. A Tribunal that will ensure the fair and lawful punishment of those who started this history of disasters and tragedies, which has become the biggest war in Europe since World War II., Our efforts will be enough to record the crimes of the Russian occupiers; to gather all the evidence so that it is absolutely admissible in the courts; to establish each of the guilty. However, those people whose decisions led to this array of crimes must not hide behind the so-called immunity of officials. The principle of inevitability of punishment must also apply to these people. And this can only be ensured by the Special Tribunal on Aggression against Ukraine., And in addition to such a Tribunal, an instrument for compensation for all damages caused by aggression is also needed., Time is merciless and plays into the hands of Russia. People can't wait long for justice. If justice is delayed, people feel as if there is no justice., Today, the world no longer recalls the terrible Russian crimes that were committed at the beginning of the aggression against our state - back in 2014 and 2015. Now the feelings in the world about Mariupol, about ""Azovstal"", about Bucha are completely different - much less intense., Of course, people have not changed their assessment of these and other crimes. However, to ensure a feeling that justice is being restored, it is necessary not only to punish the guilty. It is necessary to give the victims of crimes full assistance and to rebuild everything destroyed by this aggression. The aggressor must lose both on the battlefield and at the level of meanings, so that the war becomes a heavy loss, first of all, for the aggressor, not for the victims., Please pay attention - the same group of people is behind all the thousands of crimes committed during Russia's war against Ukraine. Those who give criminal orders. Those who always tell the same lies. Those who have been thinking for nine years already how to make it worse and more painful for everyone around them, how to cause more losses to other states and nations., The life and wealth of this group of people is ensured by other individuals and legal entities. By the assets registered on them. By the property they own openly or secretly. By the money they hid in different jurisdictions and in different forms - private, state or quasi-state., Therefore, Ukraine proposed to create a special compensation mechanism. We believe that compensation for the damage caused by Russian aggression can be ensured at the expense of Russian assets and funds located outside the borders of Russia - in other jurisdictions. And we must understand that the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine is an extremely complex project that can become successful with the help of partners. And the sooner the compensation mechanism starts working, the more effectively the assets of the terrorist state will be converted into compensation, and the less financial burden our partners will bear., And now I would like to thank Canada and other countries that are working to make their legislation allow for this kind of reimbursement process. We have to make it global - so that no one in the world will think again that aggression against a sovereign state contrary to international law can be tolerable for the aggressor. We need just such a global legal path, which will reflect one of our common values - the rule of law., Ladies and Gentlemen!, Justice must always do its job. And our task, the task of all politicians, is to give justice the necessary tools., The power of the law, its supremacy is ensured only when there are effective and stable institutions capable of implementing the law in any conditions., We know what institutions we need. We can create them. And they will definitely work., And this will be a contribution to the protection of the world order, the world legal order, that can be compared only to the Nuremberg trials. This is our joint task., I thank you for your help!, I thank you for your attention!, Glory to Ukraine!"
13 July 2022  - 22:11 ,"If we manage to remove the Russian threat to navigation in the Black Sea, it will remove the severity of the world food crisis - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today I signed a decree awarding the Order of Merit of the 1st degree to Maryna Viazovska, a Ukrainian mathematician who became a laureate of the Fields Medal this year., This is a very important and prestigious award - it is called the Nobel Prize in Mathematics., Ukrainian Mrs. Viazovska became the second woman in the entire history of the award since 1936 to win this medal. She managed to solve the problem of packing spheres in eight-dimensional space. As scientists note, Maryna Viazovska offered very powerful ideas and helped solve related problems., Today I want to thank Mrs. Maryna. Not only for her work, for a very powerful mathematical result, but also for the fact that she helps all of us, all Ukrainians, protect our freedom and independence. In particular, during the ceremony of awarding the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians, in her speech Mrs. Maryna spoke about Ukraine, about Russia's war against our country, about the crimes of the Russian occupiers., Mrs. Maryna studied in Ukraine, in Kyiv, she works in Switzerland, in Lausanne, heads the department of number theory. And I believe that the day will come when Maryna Viazovska will be able to return to Ukraine and teach here., I took part in the work of the ""Asian Leadership"" conference, which takes place every year in Seoul, the capital of the Republic of Korea. This is one of those platforms that attracts the attention of the entire region. And it is important for Ukraine that our interests and values are heard and perceived in all parts of the world, especially in the leading countries of Asia. I thanked them for their support and called for more active opposition to Russian terror tactics., And what an evil irony: today the representatives of the occupation structures in Donetsk announced that they were, as they say, recognized by the DPRK. Of course, we will react in a very tough manner at all levels. But this is the news that does not even need additional comments. Everything is obvious. The path we are taking and the path the occupiers can lead to., Debris clearance continues after the Russian attack on the city of Chasiv Yar. As of this time, the list of the dead includes 48 people, including one child. Unfortunately, the number of those rescued has not changed - 9 people. Rescuers will work on site until all debris is cleared. It was one of the most brutal Russian strikes during the entire war - so many victims... My condolences to the relatives and friends of the victims., I am preparing to address the participants of the forum in The Hague in the Netherlands, which will be held tomorrow and dedicated to the prosecution of Russian war criminals. World democracies are willing to do everything necessary to make every Russian terrorist responsible for evil against Ukrainians. And we must coordinate our efforts in such a way that all the guilty receive fair sentences. There will be a tribunal., Today in the news there are many references to the meeting in Turkey regarding the unblocking of agricultural exports from our country through the Black Sea. We are indeed making significant efforts to restore the supply of food to the world market. And I am grateful to the United Nations and Turkey for their respective efforts. The success of this story is needed not only by our state, but also, without exaggeration, by the whole world. If we manage to remove the Russian threat to navigation in the Black Sea, it will remove the severity of the world food crisis. The Ukrainian delegation informed me that there is some progress. We will agree on the details with the UN Secretary General in the coming days., In the evening, as usual, I signed the decree awarding our warriors. 136 combatants were awarded state awards, 25 of them posthumously., Eternal memory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine!, Eternal gratitude to everyone who protects our country!, Glory to Ukraine!"
13 July 2022  - 15:04 ,"Russian tactics must not become the norm, the world order must be restored - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the ""Asian Leadership"" conference in Seoul",", Dear Mr. President!, Ladies and Gentlemen!, Almost three months ago, on April 11, I addressed the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people. I spoke then about our independence - this is the main thing that Russia wants to take away from us. It was to deprive us of our independence that Russia started this brutal war of destruction. Ukraine became the first target. And I talked about the fact that Russia plans to go further to other countries in Europe and Asia. This is its strategy., But what is its tactic?, The hundred days that have passed since my address to your parliament have fully revealed Russia's tactics. Every detail of it. This is terror., And if it remains unpunished, you will see it repeated in other parts of the world, in other countries. Because tactic is something that is very easy to learn when you see it working. And various tyrannies are now looking to see if Russian tactic will work., The first tactical point - artillery takes our cities hostage. The Russian army organizes its offensive so that its howitzers and MLRS can hit ordinary residential areas of ordinary cities. For example, this was exactly the goal of the invaders in the spring, when Russian soldiers moved from the northern border of our state to our capital, in order to have the opportunity to either destroy Kyiv with artillery, or blackmail us with such destruction., The Ukrainian army has ousted the Russians from the northern territories, but the occupiers remain in the east and south of our country and build their offensive in the same way - so that ordinary houses are within the range of their howitzers and MLRS., The second point is missile terror. 2,960 missiles as of this morning - that's how much Russia managed to launch at our cities. And the main targets of missiles are civilian objects., Imagine an ordinary shopping mall or school somewhere in Incheon or Gwangju. How would you react to a large anti-ship missile hitting such targets? Which was developed to destroy aircraft carriers. And hundreds of similar strikes? Of course, this is a tactic. Russia's tactic, which is aimed at expelling people from our cities and making every Ukrainian fear the terrorist state., The third point is deportation. Just imagine this number - two million people. So many of our people have already been taken to Russia. Several hundred thousand children. No one will tell the exact numbers at the moment - all these deported people are deprived of means of communication, their documents are taken away from them, they are intimidated and taken to remote areas of Russia to make it as difficult as possible for them to return to their homeland., How will we then take our people back from all those places where people were forcibly deported?, Moreover, Russia forcibly created so-called filtration camps, through which it forces people to pass in the occupied territory. Tens of thousands of people remain there. Young women disappear there. I think you all understand what is happening with them there., The fourth point of Russian tactic is an economic shock. And this concerns not only us. Look at just one example - the events in Sri Lanka. The shocking rise in food and fuel prices caused a social explosion. No one knows now how it will end. However, you all know that the same outbursts are possible in other countries affected by food and energy crises., And what led to the aggravation of these crises? Russia's cynical blockade of our seaports, which does not allow the critically important supply of Ukrainian food to the world market. And also a completely thought-out Russian game to raise energy prices., And the fifth point of Russian tactic is propaganda. Probably, no other state in the world has spent so much money on the deliberate dissemination of disinformation, anti-scientific conspiracy theories, in particular regarding vaccines, as Russia does., Is Asia free from such Russian lies? Unfortunately no., Ladies and Gentlemen!, It is now 2022. No city in the world should be held hostage by artillery. Every nation terrorized by missiles should receive adequate assistance and protection from other free nations. Any attempts at deportation in today's world must receive the toughest response from the international community. Any state that blocks ports and makes the sea deadly dangerous must pay such a price for its behavior through sanctions, which will demonstrate to all potential aggressors of the world that repeating such Russian tactics is extremely unprofitable. And, finally, all the countries of the world must protect themselves from those who try to spread their influence through the ""means of mass lies."", Russia's war against Ukraine is actually a global issue. The issue of not only the future of our nation, but also the future of dozens of other nations., Will democracy withstand the attacks of tyranny?, Will humanity find effective means of responding to the deliberate terror of a larger state against a smaller state?, Will such global mechanisms finally be created to protect every nation from hunger?, Will we all have enough leadership to resist evil, whatever it may be, be it armed aggression or pandemic?, Russian tactics must not become the global norm, and the world order must be restored., When Ukraine turns to partners for weapons for its defense and for strengthening sanctions against a terrorist state, it is not only about our defense. It's like vaccines: if you don't help other nations, you have to be prepared for new strains of the virus that will make your own defense ineffective., And I am sincerely grateful to the Republic of Korea, which realizes that this is the situation, that we should act together., And I believe that the effectiveness of joint efforts can be such that in another hundred days I can address the people of Korea again and thank them for the fact that the aggressor has really been punished, and all other potential aggressors in the world have no alternative to a normal peaceful life., Thank you for your attention!, Glory to Ukraine!"
12 July 2022  - 22:42 ,"Now Ukraine not only implements NATO standards, but also can participate in the development of new standards - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today I would like to highlight one decision that looks like a technical one, but there is a lot of symbolism and meaningful political work behind it. Ukraine became an associate member of NATO's special multilateral program on technological interoperability. To put it more simply, it is about Alliance’s standards. Now Ukraine not only implements NATO standards, but also can participate in the development of new standards., The experience of our military, the capabilities of Ukrainian institutions, the IT potential of our country - all this will now be the Ukrainian contribution to the development of collective security in Europe., And when does it happen? On the 139th day of a full-scale war, with which Russia planned to destroy us in a week. And the Ukrainian state not only survived, not only defends itself, but also develops and will help the development of its partners. Such success is worth noting., Every day we receive and experience a lot of painful news. The war continues, Russian shelling does not stop for a single day. Today there were regular strikes at Mykolaiv - missiles, artillery. The occupiers once again hit Kharkiv and the communities of the region - Staryi Saltiv, Zolochiv, Bayrak and others. There are victims - wounded and killed. In Donbas, offensive attempts do not stop, the situation there does not get easier, and the losses do not get smaller. We must remember this. We must see this, draw attention to this., And it should also be remembered that even in such conditions, the state takes steps forward - in cooperation with partners - in institutional development. And, of course, on the frontline., The occupiers have already felt very well what modern artillery is, and they will not have a safe rear anywhere on our land, which they occupied. They have felt that the operations of our reconnaissance officers to protect their Homeland are much more powerful than any of their ""special operations"". Russian soldiers - and we know this from interceptions of their conversations - are truly afraid of our Armed Forces., 139 days of such a war, almost 20 weeks... The so-called second army of the world is afraid of Ukrainians and is able to do something only on the basis of bottomless stocks of old Soviet weapons., They no longer have strategic strength, character, or understanding of what they are doing here on our land. They also don’t have even an iota of courage to admit defeat and withdraw troops from Ukrainian territory., Today in Kyiv, I held talks with Mariusz Błaszczak, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense of Poland. And he brought us ""Krabs"" - those that will powerfully feed our enemy with fire., Of course, the key topic of our negotiations was further defense cooperation. But it is important not only what we talked about, but also how we talked. With absolute confidence in the Ukrainian future. In the Ukrainian European future., The same goes for all my other negotiations. It is always felt., A really difficult road is ahead. Unfortunately, it is impossible to do otherwise when you are protecting your home from a terrorist assault. But it is also clear that what lies ahead is the success of our state. Ukraine will be able to defend itself. Ukraine will be able to rebuild itself. Ukraine will be able to fulfill all its foreign policy goals., When millions of people work sincerely for this - each and every one at their own level - the result will be inevitable., And you know, for some reason I rarely thanked ordinary people who work in Ukraine. Who stay here no matter what. Who do their job every day. With faith in Ukraine, with faith in victory. Now I want to thank you all. Thank you for having you. Thank you for being with Ukraine., In the evening, as always, I signed the decree awarding our heroes. 156 warriors were awarded state awards. 56 of them - posthumously., Eternal glory to all those who gave their lives for Ukraine!, Eternal glory to all those who fight for the future of our people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
11 July 2022  - 22:32 ,The decision on the exception to sanctions will be perceived in Russia exclusively as a manifestation of weakness - address by the President of Ukraine,", Ukrainians!, All our defenders!, Today was a difficult day., First, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had to summon Canada's representative to our country due to an absolutely unacceptable exception to the sanctions regime against Russia. It's not just about some Nord Stream turbine that Canada shouldn't have, but still decided to hand over. Hand over actually to Russia. This is about common rules., If a terrorist state can squeeze out such an exception to sanctions, what exceptions will it want tomorrow or the day after tomorrow? This question is very dangerous. Moreover, it is dangerous not only for Ukraine, but also for all countries of the democratic world., The decision on the exception to sanctions will be perceived in Moscow exclusively as a manifestation of weakness. This is their logic. And now, there can be no doubt that Russia will try not just to limit as much as possible, but to completely shut down the supply of gas to Europe at the most acute moment. This is what we need to prepare for now, this is what is being provoked now., Because every concession in such conditions is perceived by the Russian leadership as an incentive for further, stronger pressure., Of course, this decision on one turbine, which leads to many other problems, can still be revised. Russia has never played by the rules in the energy sector and it will not play now unless it sees strength., Debris clearance continues all day in the city of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region. The day before yesterday, Russian terrorists hit two high-rise buildings, and as of now 31 people are known to be killed. Nine were saved., Kharkiv faced new brutal attacks by the Russian army. Another rocket hit a residential building - one block was completely destroyed. In the morning, the occupiers shelled the Saltivka and Kyiv districts with rocket artillery – five people were killed., The Odesa region was hit by missiles, extremely violent hostilities continued in the Donetsk region and on the territory of the Luhansk region., My condolences to all relatives and friends of the deceased…, And against such a background, it's just a shame to see people lacking the courage to honestly deal with one turbine., Today I submitted to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine a very important draft law - on legal and social guarantees for Polish citizens residing in Ukraine. In fact, this is a response to the law that was adopted by the Polish state in the spring in the interests of our citizens. In particular, I propose to give our Polish brothers the opportunity to legally stay in Ukraine for 18 months, the right to employment, economic activity, study at our universities, medical care., I ask the people's deputies of Ukraine to consider this draft law as conscientiously as possible., In relations with Poland, we have reached the highest level of trust and cooperation not just in decades, but in the lifetime of many generations of our nations. And we must increase it, we must further strengthen our ties in all spheres and on the basis of a clear understanding that Ukraine and Poland can be free only together - in brotherhood., Today, I also signed a decree conferring the honorary title of the Rescuer City upon the city of Przemyśl. For the extremely significant contribution of the city authorities, volunteers and residents to help our people and our defense. Let me remind you that this is the second such decision – the Polish city of Rzeszów was the first to receive this title., I held important negotiations with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte in Kyiv. We discussed our defense cooperation, financial assistance for Ukraine and the further progress of our country on the European path. I am thankful for the strong support, which is currently the largest in the entire history of Ukrainian-Dutch relations., I had a conversation with President of Turkey Erdoğan. The key issue is the restoration of our export routes through the Black Sea. We are working on making it possible. The sooner this happens, the fewer people in the world will feel the impact of the food crisis that was so carefully prepared by Russia., In the evening, I signed another decree on awarding our heroes. 287 combatants received state awards., I am grateful to everyone who defends the people and the state!, I am grateful to everyone who works for the victory!, I believe that thanks to you, the sun will rise in Ukraine., Glory to Ukraine!"
10 July 2022  - 22:25 ,"The retreat of the occupiers from Ukrainian land is inevitable, as is their punishment, but we must fight together for this - address by the President of Ukraine",", Ukrainians!, All our defenders!, I have been receiving reports all day long today from the city of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region. A rescue operation is underway there after a Russian strike at residential buildings. Two high-rise buildings were destroyed. Dozens of people are under the rubble. Six were saved. There are 15 names in the list of the dead and, unfortunately, this is not the final number., It was a missile strike. And everyone who gives orders for such strikes, everyone who carries them out targeting our ordinary cities, residential areas, kills absolutely deliberately. After such strikes, the killers will not be able to say they did not know something or did not understand something... All those who carried out this shelling, other missile strikes, all those who hit our cities with rocket artillery, as is the case with the Kharkiv region, Zaporizhzhia, Kryvyi Rih, Siversk and Vuhledar in the Donetsk region - they will all be found., You know, Nazi murderers are found and brought to justice even when they are 90 or 100 years old. They are caught all over the world. Of course, we don't want to wait that long. But I give this example to show that punishment is inevitable for every Russian murderer. Absolutely everyone. Just as for the Nazis. And they should not expect that their state will protect them. Russia will be the first to abandon them when political circumstances change., Since the beginning of this invasion, Ukrainian law enforcement officers have been doing everything necessary to record the crimes of the occupiers and to collect evidence. Our partners from many countries are involved in this work. Russian terror has long crossed the line beyond which it became obvious to many in the civilized world that it is a matter of global security to punish Russia, a terrorist state, for everything it has done against Ukraine and the international legal order., My schedule for the coming weeks includes precisely such negotiations and appeals that will contribute to the restoration of justice, to the punishment of Russian war criminals. Moreover, this activity is aimed not only at Europe and other traditional regions for the work of Ukrainian diplomacy. We will do everything so that Latin America, Asia and Africa hear the truth about Russian terror on our land as well., In the past week, many talked about the alleged ""operational pause"" in the actions of the occupiers in Donbas and other parts of Ukraine. 34 airstrikes by Russian aircraft over the past day is an answer to all those who came up with this ""pause"". The Ukrainian army is holding on firmly, repelling attacks in various directions. But, of course, a lot still needs to be done so that Russian losses really cause such pause. Moreover, the pause not before new offensives of the occupiers, but before their retreat from our Ukrainian land. And I am grateful to all our fighters who are bringing this time closer., It is inevitable, as is the punishment for the occupiers. But we have to hold on, we have to fight together on all fronts now - on the political, information and economic fronts, without showing weakness anywhere. We can withstand this war only together - absolutely everyone, every Ukrainian man, every Ukrainian woman., Glory to all who protect our native state!, Glory to Ukraine!"
9 July 2022  - 22:15 ,"Russia's terrorist actions can be stopped only with modern, high-precision, potent weapons – address of President of Ukraine ",", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you all health!, A brief report on the events of the day – it's already the 136th day of our defense., Today, I held a meeting with President of the French Senate Gerard Larcher and a delegation of senators after Mr. Larcher delivered his speech in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. And I am grateful to him for his inspired and neat address. The address, in which he reminded, in particular, that the front line holds as long as the rear holds, and our rear is now not only the free part of Ukraine, but also all 27 countries of the European Union, the entire democratic world. Therefore, our entire team, the Ukrainian team, works 24/7 to keep the interests of our state and our defense in the focus of every country that is already or may become part of our anti-war coalition., Mr. Larcher also said another important thing: with every attack on Ukraine, with every crime of the Russian occupiers, with every new martyr city, the resoluteness of Europeans to help Ukraine becomes more stable. It really is. However, the terrorist state does not understand this at all and will never accept it as a fact. Only in one day, the Russian army attacked the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv, Kryvy Rih, the communities of Zaporizhzhia region... It fired precisely at the residential sector – absolutely deliberately, purposefully, at ordinary houses and civilian objects. There are casualties – dead, wounded. The brutal strikes of the Russian artillery in Donbas do not stop for a single day – the Sloviansk direction, Bakhmut, Avdiyivka... You can really stop such terrorist actions only with modern, high-precision and potent weapons., And I want to thank the United States of America for the decision to provide Ukraine with a new defense aid package in the amount of $400 million. Additional HIMARS launchers units and other high-precision weapons allow us to take precisely anti-terrorist steps and reduce Russian attack capabilities., I held a meeting today with representatives of construction companies – with those on whom the quality of Ukrainian infrastructure – our supply routes – depends. The question of building a high-quality transport network is always also a question of safety. And in the conditions of the full-scale war, strong infrastructure is one of the key elements of defense. I thanked the representatives of the construction companies for their work, discussed with them the key tasks for the near future – it concerns both the reconstruction of our country and the additional strengthening of our logistics., Today, I signed decrees on the dismissal of some ambassadors of Ukraine. This rotation is a normal part of diplomatic practice. New representatives of Ukraine will be appointed to the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Norway and India. Candidates are being prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs., I am already preparing for the new week – there will be important news, including from government officials., Thank you to everyone who defends the state!, Glory to Ukraine!"
9 July 2022  - 00:37 ,Officials on the ground must do more than possible to guarantee people a normal standard of living in wartime conditions – address of President of Ukraine,", I wish good health to you, dear Ukrainians!, Today, I worked all day in the field – in the city of Dnipro and in the region, in Kryvy Rih. I was on the front lines of our defense in Dnipropetrovsk region. I listened to the reports of the commanders, thanked our boys and girls, who are defending the region, on behalf of all Ukrainians., I awarded the Golden Star to the Hero of Ukraine, Lieutenant Colonel Oleh Hrudzevych – commander of the tank battalion. Thanks to his personal bravery, his unit got out of the encirclement without casualties and destroyed the Russian sabotage group in a battle. A very strong person, you can feel it., I visited the famous Mechnikov Hospital in Dnipro to personally thank our special heroes – all the doctors and nurses who have been rescuing our wounded soldiers and civilians every day since February 24 and since 2014. They are extremely successful on their front lines and gave second birthdays, saved the lives of thousands of our people., I presented state awards to our defenders who are recovering from injuries., I am really very grateful for all the kind words I heard today in Dnipro, that I heard on the front line. Thank you, first of all., Today, I addressed the Parliament of Slovenia. Every day and under any circumstances, we work as much as possible on the foreign policy front. And, by the way, this was already the twenty-fourth address to the parliaments of the EU countries and the first that was made near the front line. I hope that the three other EU countries will also feel that these appeals are not about politics, but about the protection of our common freedom, by the way, and therefore, we will come to the point that one day I will be able to say: all 27 parliaments of the European Union hear the struggle for freedom better than any Russian manipulations., I also held all the necessary meetings with the leaders of Dnipropetrovsk region in general and Kryvy Rih district in particular – both military and civilian. It was about security, economy, social issues. Officials must do not just everything possible, but much more than even possible, to guarantee people a normal standard of living even in such wartime conditions., I am returning to the capital of Ukraine., Of course, I want to say two more things., I congratulated Chief Commissar Zaluzhny on his birthday today. I wished him good health, I wished him and all of us the most important thing – victory. Thank you for your service!, And tomorrow, on July 9, and in fact already after sunset today, the Muslim community begins to celebrate Kurban Bayram. This is a special holiday that teaches sacrifice and guides people to do good deeds. I want to congratulate now all Muslims of Ukraine and the world and wish that the rule of peace is restored, and all kinds of evil always lose the sooner the better. The Crimean Tatar people especially expect this, and I believe that the year will come when we will welcome each other in a free Crimea., Kurban Bayramınız Hayırlı ve mübarek olsun! Congratulations on the blessed holiday - Kurban Bayram!, Glory to Ukraine!"
8 July 2022  - 16:45 ,Address by the President to the Parliament of Slovenia,", Dear Mrs. President,, Dear Mr. President,, Dear Mr. Prime Minister,, Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,, People of Slovenia!, It is an honor for me to address you in such a special format. And, by the way, now I am near the frontline, so my words in this address are strengthened by the emotions and hopes that our defenders shared with me., I am grateful to all the countries of the European Union in which such appeals of mine took place. We know that Russia tried to disrupt them, tried to use its various connections - political, diplomatic, even business. In Moscow they understand that they have nothing to oppose such trust between the people of Ukraine and Europe and such communication activity with., Therefore, they threatened Europeans, manipulated those who depend on them. But this is already the twenty-fourth parliament of the twenty-seven countries of the European Union, and I want to congratulate you on this obvious evidence that Russia has lost its influence in the European Union. The fact remains the following: most of the countries of the European Union cannot be ruled by Russia. And this is a new political reality in Europe, which we achieved together - every country that stood up for the defense of our common freedom., Everything we said about ourselves became our actions to protect ourselves and our democratic way of life. We don't just enjoy freedom, we have made its defense a key goal of our anti-war coalition. We have not just achieved a new unity on the European continent, but are taking new and strong security, political and economic steps on its basis. And legal steps are next, namely: bringing Russian war criminals to justice., Most importantly, by going through this terrible challenge of the Russian war together, we prove that European values do not remain just a reference to old treaties and conventions, do not serve as formal criteria only at the level of rhetoric, but are the real basis of life on the continent here and now., And every country of the united Europe made its contribution to this. Not only those who occupy a large area on the map and who are used to attending the summits of the ""great"". A free Europe is the result of the principles of all, and in particular those who do not have significant military or economic resources to resist Russian pressure, but who can fight thanks to their honesty and brave heart. Today I want to thank you, friends. I want to thank the entire Slovenian people, for your honesty and for your brave heart., A little more than two weeks ago, the European Council endorsed the decision to grant Ukraine the status of a candidate for joining the European Union. And this is one of those powerful political steps based on our new unity that strengthens us all on the continent. I am very grateful to you, Slovenia, for supporting us, supporting our candidacy. No one can say now how long our path from application to full membership will take, but we all know that the dream of a peaceful, free and stable Europe will not be realized without Ukraine as part of the European Union. And these are not just words, but another fact that will forever remain a fact., That is why Russia started a large-scale offensive on Europe from Ukraine, because Moscow is fully aware of the importance of Ukraine for the European project. And that is why Russia will inevitably lose, because Europe will not be split up, divided into pieces - as it was before. The eastern border of Europe is now equal to the eastern border of Ukraine, and one day, I believe soon, our eastern border will be marked: the territory of the European Union., In Moscow, they say that they are not enemies of Europe. The Russian leadership uses various propaganda theses to justify itself. But let's look at their actions. Who are they hitting?, Russia hit the Europeans with the gas crisis - and for the second year in a row, it is deliberately making efforts to ensure that European gas storage facilities remain unfilled before winter. Russia has driven gas prices in Europe to an all-time high – deliberately limiting supply in defiance of market rules. What did it lead to? Catastrophic inflation. If there were no such prices for energy resources, there would be no such painful consequences for the majority of people in Europe., Russia is also preparing another strike - migration. When the Russian fleet blocked our ports, it was a deliberate decision not just against Ukraine, but against everyone in the world who depends on food imports. And you can already see the consequences. But this is only the beginning, because without our food it will not be possible to stabilize the world market, save the countries of Africa and Asia from hunger. If there is a famine there, it means you will see new migrants on the territory of the EU. Millions of new migrants., I gave only a few examples from the wide palette of Russia's anti-European actions. If the Russian leadership really sought to weaken someone other than Europe, as they claim, then Moscow would not hit the wallets of the residents of even those European countries that tried to be friendly to Russia to the last, and would not try to break the internal social stability of European countries., But thanks to cooperation with Ukraine, the European Union can protect itself, in particular, from such challenges. I will give you a few more examples., Our country joined the unified European energy system. We have a significant surplus in the production of electricity even now, when Russian marauders are dismantling and taking away solar power plants from the occupied regions of Ukraine, and have significantly limited our coal generation by their actions. We started exporting electricity to Romania and Slovakia - at a price that is significantly lower than the prices in the EU. We can quickly increase exports by ten or more times - and this will allow Ukrainian electricity to replace a significant part of European imports of Russian gas. Thanks to our electricity, all European neighbors of Ukraine can get a new energy stability, and therefore a decrease in energy prices in Europe., Let's not forget about the Ukrainian gas storage facilities - the most convenient for our region, large in volume, and therefore able to strengthen the European gas market and make the European Union more prepared for winter seasons., It is the same with agricultural production. Even this year, during a full-scale war, the Ukrainian harvest of grain and oil crops will reach tens of millions of tons. For example, without Ukrainian corn, meat production in Europe and the world suffers - and therefore prices rise. Without our wheat and sunflower oil, there will be shortages in many countries - and therefore prices will rise. I emphasize once again: Russia deliberately blocked our exports in order to worsen the price crisis, to make it catastrophic, including for Europeans., But together with our partners in the European Union - at the level of Brussels and neighboring countries - we are creating new export routes. And the more such green corridors for Ukrainian food through the territory of the EU are created, the sooner we will guarantee protection for the south of Europe from new waves of migration, and therefore guarantee the preservation of internal social stability in the EU countries., Colossal opportunities also open up from the integration of our country into the digital market of the European Union - the business world is well aware of the potential of Ukrainian IT specialists. Industrial cooperation with us, as well as the joint implementation of the project of the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine, can give the whole of Europe such an economic boost that will have historical weight and will be remembered in the same way as the implementation of the Marshall Plan after World War II. And I invite your country, as well as Slovenian companies and specialists, to join the reconstruction of Ukraine. The volume of work is already about a trillion dollars., And, of course, security. Can anyone now imagine Europe reliably protected from aggression without Ukrainian heroes? Russian tyranny wants to regain control over all the countries it could once reach. And in order for all the capitals from Ljubljana to Helsinki to feel safe, Ukraine must withstand, preserve one hundred percent of its sovereignty, recover from this war and become a long-term guarantor of Europe's security against Russian revanchism. In order to get to you, they have to get through us, and therefore everyone in Europe is interested in Ukraine winning and being a part of common security formats with the Europeans., We are not going to delay. Ukraine realized its strength. You realized our strength. And this is our historical responsibility - of all leaders working in Europe today - to ensure maximum integration of Ukraine into the European Union. We must become a full member of the EU thanks to the fact that we share common values and for the full realization of the potential of our cooperation in many fields., Your writer, Rudi Kerševan, has some very apt words that perfectly describe the current situation: ""We enrich our lives not with things that have a price, but with things that have value."" Starting from February 24, Europe focused precisely on what has value, and in a few months this gave progress that had not been seen in decades. Europe is united as never before. Europe has greater agency than ever. Europe has a future that will provide stability like never before. But all this is possible only together with Ukraine. And I believe that when the time comes for the Slovenian Presidency of the European Union, we will ensure that our relations reach another fundamental level - the level of a positive result in the negotiations regarding Ukraine's membership in the EU., Thank you for your attention!, Skupaj bomo zmagali!, Glory to Ukraine!"
7 July 2022  - 22:59 ,"The greater the defense aid to Ukraine is now, the sooner the war will end and the smaller the losses of all countries in the world will be - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today, the main topic in our country has become the British topic - Boris Johnson's decision to resign as party leader and Prime Minister. In the afternoon I spoke with him and thanked for the support we have received since the first day of Russian terror., First of all, these are weapons: Stinger air defense systems, cool NLAW anti-tank systems, artillery, ammunition, armored vehicles and many, many other things. Substantial political support, strong sanctions against Russia, financial assistance to our state - more than two billion pounds have been allocated for security and defense needs alone since February 24., Britain's role in protecting freedom is truly global. And although this is a reflection of the position of British society, the leadership and charisma of the state leader are always of special importance. Especially at such a time - the time of Russia's full-scale anti-European war, which started its attack on Europe precisely from our state. So it is not surprising that Ukrainians feel personal gratitude to Boris., But let's not forget that we are building relations between states. Great Britain's support for Ukraine should not change, no matter what happens in London's power circles, both Boris and all our friends in the United Kingdom assured me of this., I met today in Kyiv with representatives of the US Congress - Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal. They represent both parties, Republican and Democratic, and both support Ukraine very fundamentally. They were the authors of the resolution calling on the Department of State to recognize Russia as a state - sponsor of terrorism. I thanked them for this activity and hope that it will be brought to fruition., I informed the senators about the situation on the frontline, about what the occupiers are preparing for. In particular, we talked about Donbas, the south of our country, the Kharkiv region. Today, the Russian army hit Kramatorsk again - again with missiles. The occupiers also hit Kharkiv, the cities of Donbas..., In each direction, our partners have accurate information about our defense needs. This concerns air defense, modern MLRS. The greater the defense aid to Ukraine is now, the sooner the war will end with our victory and the smaller will be the losses of all countries of the world, the losses of the United States from Russian pressure on democratic societies., Tomorrow I will continue the series of appeals to the European parliaments - it is Slovenia's turn. Tomorrow there will also be a lot of internal Ukrainian news - a very meaningful day is ahead., After the conference in Lugano, which was dedicated to the recovery of Ukraine, government officials have already agreed on emergency aid to our country in the amount of more than $2 billion - these funds will be directed to strengthening the budget and preparing for winter. By the way, export of Ukrainian electricity to EU countries, which has already started, is a significant support both now and during the heating season. The price of electricity on the European market is higher than in Ukraine, and this will enable energy companies to use the earned funds to provide services for Ukrainian consumers. Moreover, with unchanged tariffs., Also, government officials are actively working on the logistics of agricultural exports. I heard the reports from the Minister of Infrastructure and the Minister of Agrarian Policy on this topic today. We will do everything to maintain access to the world market despite the Russian blockade of our ports., And, of course, today I want to express gratitude for the final stage of the struggle for Zmiinyi - our national flag was hoisted there. This operation lasted two months. Intelligence, Special Operations Forces, ""Alpha"" unit of the Security Service, border guards, gunners, Navy, Air Force. And now let every Russian captain - whether of a ship or an aircraft - see the Ukrainian flag on Zmiinyi and know that our state cannot be broken., I am grateful to everyone who defends Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
6 July 2022  - 22:30 ,"Artillery from our Western partners started working very powerfully, so the losses of the occupiers will only increase - address by the President of Ukraine",", Ukrainians!, All our defenders!, Today in Kharkiv, the Pedagogical University was destroyed by a Russian missile strike - the main building, lecture halls, university museum, scientific library. This characterizes the Russian invasion with 100% accuracy. When it comes to the definition of barbarism, this strike fits the bill the most. Only an enemy of civilization and humanity can do such things - strike missiles at a university, a pedagogical university., Already the second object dedicated to Hryhoriy Skovoroda was damaged by this strike - a monument that was on the square in front of the university. It was covered with debris, but still the monument is not broken. And the Skovoroda museum located in the Kharkiv region burned down after Russian shelling back in May. However, paraphrasing the most famous words of Skovoroda, no matter how hard the occupiers try to catch us, they will fail. We will definitely endure. And we will restore everything., Finally it is felt that the Western artillery - the weapons we received from our partners - started working very powerfully. Its accuracy is exactly as needed. Our defenders inflict very noticeable strikes on depots and other spots that are important for the logistics of the occupiers. And this significantly reduces the offensive potential of the Russian army. The losses of the occupiers will only increase every week, as will the difficulty of supplying them., Today, the general public became aware that in the south of our country, in the occupied areas, access to social networks, messengers and YouTube was closed. Russian forces have blocked any possibility for people to know the truth about what is happening and about our potential, which we are gradually increasing., Ukrainian forces are currently advancing in several tactical directions, in particular in the south - in the Kherson region, in the Zaporizhzhia region. We will not give up our land - the entire sovereign territory of Ukraine will be Ukrainian. People should know it. Therefore, if you have an opportunity to speak with people in the south of our country - with Kherson, Henichesk, Berdyansk, Melitopol and other cities and villages - please spread the truth there. Use every opportunity to tell the people in the occupied areas that we remember them and we are fighting for them. We are fighting for our entire south, for the entire Ukrainian Donbas - the most brutal confrontation is currently there, near Slovyansk and Bakhmut. We are fighting for the Kharkiv region. The occupiers should not think that their time on this land is long-lasting and that the superiority of their artillery is eternal., I held a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief Staff. As always, I listened to the reports both from the military and from intelligence. We jointly determined the directions of action for the near future., We are expanding our country's foreign policy vectors. For the first time in the history of Ukrainian-Paraguayan relations, I had a conversation with the President of Paraguay - we appreciate the support from this country, and we will continue to strengthen ties in Latin America. I also spoke with the President of Mozambique today - I congratulated his country on the election to the UN Security Council, and I believe that Africa should get more representation on international platforms and in solving global issues. It is the African countries that are now most threatened by the food crisis provoked by Russia, and we must do everything to force the terrorist state to unblock Ukrainian agricultural exports., A visit to Kyiv by the Prime Minister of Ireland took place, a country that helps us significantly. Ireland even helped us convince representatives of skeptical states in the European Union that Ukraine deserves candidacy and future membership in the EU. We also remember that the Senate of Ireland recognized the crimes of the Russian occupiers as genocide of the Ukrainian people. This step, as well as Ireland's support for legal efforts to punish Russian war criminals, is very important. The help of partners together with the work of Ukrainian law enforcement officers are the very bricks from which the restoration of justice for Ukraine will be built., Every Russian murderer, torturer and rapist who came to our land will be held accountable. And it doesn't matter how long it takes to complete this task. There will be no peace for any of the occupiers., I am grateful to everyone who fights for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
5 July 2022  - 21:35 ,The maximum task for our state is to provide Ukrainians with basic protection against missile strikes already this year - address by the President of Ukraine,", Ukrainians!, All our defenders!, On the night of July 5, an air alert was announced over almost the entire territory of our country. Before that, there has been no air alert in the capital and in some regions for some time, and some people even felt particularly anxious because of such unusual silence. They were overthinking, dreading, looking for some kind of explanation - as if the occupiers were preparing for something... Actually, you shouldn't overthink. You should not look for logic in the actions of terrorists. The Russian army does not take any breaks. It has one task - to take people's lives, to intimidate people - so that even a few days without an air alarm already feel like part of the terror. And this evening, Kyiv and again almost the whole of Ukraine heard the air alarm. As of now, there are reports of strikes at the Khmelnytskyi region - victims, wounded are now being specified., Our task is to hold on, to take care of ourselves, including our emotions, to help the country's defense as much as possible, to protect the state, as much as it will be necessary for our victory., The occupiers again hit the Sumy region, Mykolaiv and the region, the Dnipropetrovsk region. Some of the missiles were shot down by our air defense forces. And we have not reduced and will not reduce our diplomatic activity for a single day to obtain modern anti-missile systems for Ukraine in sufficient quantity. , This is a maximum task for our state – to provide basic security for Ukrainians, basic protection against missile attacks already this year. But the fulfillment of this task depends not only on us, but also on the understanding of our fundamental needs by our partners., I spoke today with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. I thanked him for increasing security assistance to our nation by £100 million more, on top of the £1 billion defense support package announced recently. This is a very tangible aid for us., We also discussed with Boris the system of security guarantees for Ukraine, which we are developing, which should work in the long term for our people., Together with the Presidents of Moldova and Greece I took part in the format of a special conference of The Economist. This is already the 26th such annual event, and this year Ukraine and security were, of course, the main words at it. Why do we need it? Our state needs certainty with a safe space right now. We are working very actively to ensure that all our partners both in Europe and on other continents understand our vision of security guarantees., Today, the results of two months of work of the United24 state charitable platform were summed up. Over this time, thanks to the participation of people from dozens of countries, we managed to collect more than two billion hryvnias for the needs of Ukraine. This is not only help to our defenders, but also contributions to demining and humanitarian needs., I personally thanked Liev Schreiber, a very famous actor, for joining United24 as an ambassador. He is a co-founder of the BlueCheck charitable organization, which financed programs for psychological support and evacuation of more than twenty thousand orphans from boarding schools and orphanages in the Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Chernihiv, Odesa regions. Liev's organization also helps families of IDPs in Lviv. Now he, together with Andriy Shevchenko and Elina Svitolina, will work in the humanitarian direction., And one more thing is very important. Today there were a lot of disputes in society regarding the decision of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to approve the Procedure for obtaining certain permits for those liable for military service, conscripts and reservists. I see that there are different assessments of such a decision, there is misunderstanding and even indignation in society. I instructed the Minister of Defense, the Chief of the General Staff, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces to report all the details to me during tomorrow's regular meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief as one of the items on the agenda. I promise the people to figure it out., And I ask the General Staff not to make such decisions without me in the future., Glory to Ukraine!"
5 July 2022  - 12:25 ,Speech by the President at the opening of the 26th Annual Economist Government Roundtable,", Dear Mrs. Presidents!, Ladies and Gentlemen!, Thank you for the invitation to participate in this roundtable., Now, if we look at the news about the life of our societies on any day, we will see that they are dominated by two concepts - war and crisis., A full-scale war against our state and a hybrid war against the United Europe. And if we talk about crises, it is primarily a crisis of the cost of living, which is reflected by an extraordinary rise in prices. Energy crisis. Food crisis. Migration. This is what life looks like today., And we have not yet seen the possible wars or crises that Russia is able to prepare for many countries in the coming years., Is it likely that the leadership of Russia is planning a new invasion of the territory of another neighbor? No one can rule it out., Can Russia create another crisis for all of us in Europe? It can. It is enough to look at the Russian missiles that fly over the power units of nuclear plants in Ukraine. Look and understand: we don't even have guaranteed radiation safety now., And how did all this happen?, In response, I can also cite two concepts: gray zone and assurances., Europe has experienced a security deficit for decades. Part of Europe - in the east of the continent, as well as in the Balkans - was outside any effective security architecture. You can explain it as you like, but the presence of such gray zones from the point of view of Moscow looked like a temptation., And any gray zone - be it geographical, be it political, be it economic - is considered by the leadership of Russia as a space of its opportunities - anti-democratic, anti-legal, anti-European., In fact, it was the case that the security of a part of Europe was based only on ""assurances""., You can recall various ""assurances"". Those contained in the Budapest memorandum. The ones that sounded from the European leaders who said that business and dialogue with Russia would supposedly keep it from aggression. Or those that sounded from the Russian leadership, which claimed that it has allegedly abandoned its aggressive policy., It all collapsed., And not on February 24 this year, but back in 2014, when Russia occupied the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea., And what do we have now? Again - two concepts. More unity and security guarantees., It is only through greater unity in Europe and effective security guarantees that we can respond to those threats that are currently destabilizing the continent., The future of Europe - calm and peaceful - is simply impossible without it., We need such a unity in Europe that will become the largest in history. Of course, a lot has already been done for this. But not everything yet., For example, what is happening on the energy market in Europe and is happening right now should be viewed as a war., With its gas game, Russia is doing everything to keep inflation growing and to make Europe experience the biggest crisis in history this winter., However, at the same time, we see Greek companies providing almost the largest tanker fleet for the transportation of Russian oil., Once again: this is happening precisely when another Russian energy resource is being used as a weapon against Europe and against the family budget of every European., I am sure that this does not meet the interests of Europe, Greece, or Ukraine., This is just one example of the need for even greater unity. So that Russia is forced to seek peaceful solutions - in particular, in the hybrid wars it is waging., And if we mention the Russian banking system, is it already cut off from the global financial market? No. Connections are still maintained., And therefore, there is still hope in Moscow that in the future it will somehow be possible to deceive the democratic world, somehow it will be possible to break the resistance, in particular, of European countries., Because if they made concessions in something, why won't they make concessions in something else? This is the question., I will also give an example of how greater unity gives a very practical and very concrete result for everyone., Thanks to the recent accession of Ukraine to the common European energy system, the countries of the European Union can now receive our electricity. And this makes it possible to replace a part of Russian fossil fuels - a substantial part in the energy balance of European countries. And not at a ""cosmic"" price, but much cheaper than the cost of electricity on the European market., Let's look at the second tool - security guarantees. Would Moscow attack someone who would be definitely protected?, We see now that Russia has accepted this situation and this decision - that Sweden and Finland are joining NATO. Moscow says - ""let them join"". Although earlier Russia said that the Alliance must return to the borders of 1997., This proves the fact that collective security guarantees work., Yes, Ukraine is not in NATO. And when we reached out to start a movement towards membership, we got a negative response even to the request for a Membership Action Plan., But this is not a reason for us to stop., We need such a system of security guarantees, such a safe space, which can be effective even in conditions when we are not in the Alliance., The main goal is to have no gray safety zone., We are not in NATO, but we are on this path. And there must be certainty. And certainty now., What to do to prevent aggression? What should be done to immediately stop the aggression that has started?, We want to give answers to this - and we are currently working on them with our partners. With those states that, in fact, will be able to become guarantors., If there was such a system now, there would be no war., If Ukraine had received guaranteed support with weapons, sanctions against the aggressor, immediate isolation of the aggressor, confiscation of the assets of the aggressor and all entities related to it, Ukraine would not be a victim of the most terrible war in Europe. The most terrible since World War II. All this horror would not have happened., And we must do everything so that it never happens again. This is the main task., Ladies and Gentlemen!, We are doing everything so that there will be no more gray zones in which Ukraine could find itself., We have become a candidate for joining the European Union and will do everything for integration in all possible directions. We are grateful to all European countries that have supported us on this path. We are grateful to Greece., We will create a system of security guarantees that will protect Ukraine while we are not in NATO., What is our principle?, Russia considers the territory of our state as a bridgehead for seizing other European countries, and therefore providing security to Ukraine means providing long-term security to the whole of Europe., But this applies not only to our state., Now Europe is united as never before in many decades., Even 5 years ago, it was impossible to imagine that Europe would achieve such unity, and many discussions on platforms like yours were about how far the division of Europe would go., Division, not unity., Ukraine, I believe, corrected it., And we have to work on even greater unity., Europe is a subject. It is a global subject. It should be so. And this can only happen with Ukraine., Europe must become completely independent, particularly from Russia. From its ability to put pressure on you all or on each of you separately., Is it possible? I'm sure - yes, it's possible., And when it becomes real, you will be able to say that what Europe is going through now will never happen again., The crisis of the cost of living or the threat of the migrant crisis, which will be a consequence of the food crisis, are all the consequences of those dependencies on Russia that still remained in Europe and the democratic world in general., You can look at it in different ways. You can mention various factors that influenced this., But if there wasn’t the one who makes all this worse, there would be no such acuteness of these crises, which makes them catastrophic., We can overcome all this. With unity. By strengthening collective security. With unconditional principles, without which nothing is possible - neither unity, nor security., Thank you!, Glory to Ukraine!"
4 July 2022  - 22:13 ,"The recovery of Ukraine is not only about what needs to be done after the victory, but also about what we and our partners should do now - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today was a long and very important day of our foreign policy activity., A conference devoted to the recovery of Ukraine started in Lugano, Switzerland. I want to point out right away that when they talk about recovery, they often put the emphasis incorrectly. It is not only about what we should do after our victory or in the following years, but also about what we need to do right now., Ukrainian forces liberated more than a thousand settlements from the occupiers, and new ones are added every week. Now, for example, in the south of our country. All of them suffered large-scale destruction. And this also means the need for colossal funds for the restoration of infrastructure, for the return of medicine and social services, for the restoration of normal economic life. There are tens of thousands of destroyed houses alone in the liberated areas., And we also need to prepare schools and universities for the new academic year in the entire free territory of the country and in new conditions of constant threat, in particular missile strikes... We must already prepare for the winter and do everything so that we pass this winter calmly from the point of view of energy despite the threats Russia creates every day., A significant part of the economy has been destroyed by hostilities and Russian strikes, thousands of enterprises are out of business. And this means a high need for jobs, for ensuring social benefits despite the decrease in tax revenues., That is why the recovery of Ukraine is not only about what needs to be done later, after our victory, but also about what needs to be done at this time. And we have to do it together with our partners, with the entire democratic world. Do now., Today, Prime Minister of Sweden Mrs. Andersson visited Kyiv. The main topics are defense support - we will get a new enhanced package - we are grateful. As well as new sanctions against Russia and new opportunities for Ukraine, in particular in matters of waste processing., In our country, this topic was neglected for a very long time, and it is not just about what to do with garbage. It's about safety, about quality of life. We need a minimum of 25 new and modern technologically advanced waste processing plants. They are able to provide both energy and secondary raw materials, and finally resolve the age-old problem of dumps and waste landfills, the inability of many communities to find solutions for waste., And if some people think this is untimely, I want to say that the reconstruction of our state is not just the restoration of the walls that we had and that were destroyed by shelling. Ukraine must become the freest, most modern and safest country in Europe - in every sense of the word, in particular, in terms of our environment. I'm sure we will do that., Today is July 4 - the main holiday for the United States of America, Independence Day. And I want to congratulate President Biden, the American people, and all our friends in the United States., I want to quote something. ""We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness—That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed,” the United States Declaration of Independence reads. And agree that Ukrainians have repeatedly demonstrated in their history that we have similar principles. It is enough to look at the Ukrainian Maidans or our tenacity in the defense of freedom., Congratulations again on Independence Day. Thanks for the help!, Today, I congratulated Ukrainian policemen on National Police Day and presented the awards. Law and order is based on the quality of their work., Of course, a lot still needs to be done for the Ukrainian police to fully meet the requirements of modern times. But don’t forget about the police heroes who fight on the frontline. About those who ensure demining. Who help the victims of shelling. Who conduct the evacuation. Who deliver humanitarian aid. And who provide us all with protection from crime., The situation on the frontline did not undergo significant changes during the day. The enemy continues to terrorize the border areas of the Sumy region, the city of Kharkiv and the region, Donbas. The Armed Forces of Ukraine respond, put pressure and destroy the offensive potential of the occupiers day after day. We need to break them. This is a difficult task, it requires time and superhuman efforts. But we have no alternative - this is about our independence, about our future, about the fate of the entire Ukrainian people., I am grateful to everyone who defends our country!, Glory to Ukraine!"
4 July 2022  - 16:44 ,The reconstruction of Ukraine will be the greatest contribution to the maintenance of global peace - President's speech at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Lugano,", Dear Mr. President Cassis!, Dear Mrs. President von der Leyen!, Dear Mr. Prime Minister Fiala!, Dear participants of the Conference!, Ladies and Gentlemen!, First of all, I wish to thank Mr. President of Switzerland, his team and everyone involved in the organization of our Conference. It is this Conference and its decisions that can become the first stride towards the historic victory of the democratic world., Russia's war against Ukraine is not just an attempt to seize our land and destroy our state institutions, break our independence. This is a much broader confrontation - the one in terms of the worldview., The anti-democratic and anti-European system built in Russia is trying to prove that it is supposedly stronger than all of us – Ukraine, Europe and the democratic world. It is trying to prove that Europe is allegedly weak and allegedly unable to defend its values. Such a worldview motive can be traced in all the actions of the Russian state - both in relation to Ukraine and in relation to all of you., And all the crises created by Russia - inflationary, food, energy, migrant, the contours of which are already present - are the worldview, ideological challenge., However, its most brutal manifestation is Russia's aggression against our state, against us, the first ones it wants to return to its control zone in Europe., Look at what Russia is doing, destroying Ukraine. Russia is destroying the space of everything that matters to us and to any free human life., In four months of the full-scale invasion, 2,102 educational facilities in Ukraine were destroyed. These are schools, these are universities, these are kindergartens... When the Russian army uses artillery against a kindergarten or drops bombs on a school, it destroys not just walls and not just buildings. This is the deliberate destruction of the educational space - the space in which children are socialized, in which people learn to be people., All our societies have just recovered from the COVID pandemic, when for a long time only distance education was possible. Just when everything has started to recover, just when children have found themselves in the usual space of communication, the space of friends, education... Russia came and with its strikes is trying to say that we will not have this space - our education - at all., Why is Russia shelling hospitals? How can they give an order for an airstrike on a hospital or a maternity hospital? This is Russia's manifestation that it is allegedly able to destroy the very possibility of civilization for Ukraine - the basic humanity that exists in every normal country. Russia shows that Ukrainians will not be able to even treat, even give birth to children., 799 medical infrastructure facilities have been destroyed from February 24 to the end of June. In what other country, in what other war were so many medical facilities destroyed in such a short period of time?, All this is a deliberate tactic of Russia, not just shelling, but a bet precisely on ideological confrontation. The terrorist state hopes that such destruction will prove the alleged inability of the democratic system and the European choice of our nation to give people not even normal life, but life in general., Look at the systematic destruction by the Russian army of the residential neighborhoods of our cities and the constant missile terror. Why do they do it? This is not a purely military tactic..., Each person has a space of home - and it is not only a separate apartment or house, it is a part of the city or the countryside where a person communicates, works, meets with friends, loves, raises children, visits parents. That is why the Russian occupiers fire at residential buildings with tanks or carry out artillery shelling of city blocks, that is why they target missiles on houses to destroy this entire space of life - to kill people's feeling of home., More than 12 million Ukrainians were forced to become refugees because of this war. And how many of them will still return home, even if they have a place exactly where they lived before to return to? After such a brutal war and such barbaric Russian attacks, it will be very difficult for many people to find that feeling again - the feeling of a real home., Russia's aggression still continues, and about eighty thousand objects have already been destroyed. These are tens of millions of square meters of space... And when we see such losses, we must see not just broken walls and not just broken bricks, not just burned corridors or rooms, but millions - millions of human destinies that will never be the same they were before. We must see dreams that no longer exist. Love that became impossible. We must see children who could have lived the same lives as each and every one of you, but now their lives are ruined. Russia not only deprived many Ukrainian children of their home or friends, but also made them orphans, killed their brothers and sisters..., Russia's intention is to make such ruins and such losses an alleged ""vision"" of democracy and Europe. With this aggression, Russia wants to prove that it supposedly has not just territory under its control, but life as such, and that it can supposedly decide for everyone whether they will have life at all., Therefore, this war is not just ours, not just a local one somewhere in the east of Europe. No. This is Russia's attack on everything that is of value to you and me. Therefore, the reconstruction of Ukraine is not a local project, not a project of one nation, but a joint task of the entire democratic world - of all countries, certainly all countries that can say about themselves - we are civilized., Rebuilding Ukraine means restoring the principles of life, restoring the space of life, restoring what makes people people. Of course, this means construction, large-scale construction. Of course, this means large funding and colossal investments. Of course, this means a completely new level of security throughout our country, which has to continue to live next to Russia., But it also means a new technological level. It also means an opportunity for our countries, our companies, our specialists to show why freedom is more powerful than any tyranny., Back in the spring, we started offering our partners to join the project of rebuilding Ukraine. Even then, it was obvious that this would be the biggest project of our time – economic, technological, social, and most importantly, worldview., And I am grateful to the countries that have positively accepted our proposals to take patronage over regions, cities or industries affected by the war. In particular, I am grateful to Denmark for its willingness to become a chief in the reconstruction of our city of Mykolaiv. I am grateful to Britain for its interest in the reconstruction of the Kyiv region. And in the same way, I invite all countries of the civilized world, ambitious companies and specialists to join our efforts., In addition to everything else, it will allow us to create millions of new connections in the democratic world, in Europe, between our countries. Every city, every community, every industry that will be rebuilt will have a historical record of who helped it. Just imagine - these are not just flags of the partner country at the entrance to the city, but being woven into the new fabric of life in Ukraine, traditions and heritage of all those who worked on reconstruction., And, of course, I am grateful to the European Commission for the initiative to create a special European platform for the reconstruction of Ukraine., However, all initiatives, plans, ambitions should be in a single system, in which not only the needs, but also the feelings of Ukrainians will be in the first place. Therefore, Ukraine offers its national Reconstruction Plan, on the basis of which it will be possible to implement every initiative, every idea, as well as to use the funds that will be directed to reconstruction in a completely rational way and precisely in the interests of Ukraine., And among the key principles, I would note the following - maximum security; maximum technologies; maximum compliance with environmental standards; maximum use of ""green"" technologies; maximum implementation of barrier-free principles; maximum focus on community interests; maximum transparency - in planning, use of funds, selection of projects; as well as maximum rooting of the reconstruction project in the real economic life of Ukraine in order to realize all this and for the results of the reconstruction to work long-term, which means the creation of jobs and new industries in Ukraine, the localization of your business, your business processes in Ukraine., Of course, it is not only about restoring the substance of life, but also about institutional development. Our country has become a candidate for joining the European Union. The movement towards full membership involves reforms. But the reconstruction of Ukraine also requires reforms., We still have to strengthen our institutions, we still have to update living standards. Our goal is for Ukraine to become not only the freest country in Europe and the most convenient for life and business, but also for us to complete the political part of the work the fastest of all those who moved towards the European Union., We can do it - just as we have already done the biggest reform for the countries of the European community. And this, I believe, is the most important reform and we have already implemented it. The reform of the strength of the European Union is actually the reform of the EU. The European Union is truly united - firmly united now thanks to us, thanks to Ukraine. Thanks to this reform of ours, we have actualized each of the basic values ​​of Europe. In the same way, the support of NATO states for our country means that we have united the Alliance as much as possible. The Alliance has not been so united for decades., And the reconstruction of Ukraine will be an equally great reform for all of us, because we will unite the democratic world to the extent that everyone will see: the worldview of free people always wins. The world will see that no one can ever achieve their goals through war., But now I want to make one important local emphasis., We need to act now. We have already liberated a significant territory of Ukraine - more than a thousand settlements. Challenges remain for a significant territory - economic, energy, social. Restoring school education, providing medicine for people, providing housing for displaced people, guaranteeing jobs for Ukrainians, protecting the energy industry - these are all important tasks right now, and especially on the eve of winter., Therefore, Ukraine presents two levels of action: strategic - and this means the recovery of the entire country, as well as tactical. We need this tactical help. This means the need to quickly restore everything that can be restored., Ladies and Gentlemen!, As long as the ruins remain, so does the war. As long as the aggressor can hope to destroy the very foundation of life, there will be no lasting peace., That is why the reconstruction of Ukraine will be the greatest possible contribution to maintaining global peace. We can prove that the democratic world is stronger, Europe is more powerful, that our values cannot be destroyed. And we will definitely do it., Thank you very much for your attention!, I invite you all to our beautiful country, the best in the world, to Ukraine, to work with us., Glory to Ukraine!"
4 July 2022  - 14:42 ,"Russia has chosen the path of war, Ukraine is fighting on the path to peace - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address to the Japanese university community",", Ladies and Gentlemen!, Dear attendees!, For more than four months, you’ve seen, heard and read the news with the headlines ""war in Ukraine"". Over time, such an ""abbreviation"" may distort the global picture of events and the essence of things, everyone's perception of what is happening in Ukraine, it can replace the truth., This is a war in Ukraine, which the Russian Federation started, which the Russian Federation continues, and which the Russian Federation does not want to stop. Ukraine is defending its own land, its sovereignty, its territory. Ukraine is fighting for peace. This is a cruel paradox of the XXI century, and for us these are realities., We cannot lay down our weapons, because otherwise we will disappear. As a state, as a nation, simply as people. Russia has chosen the path of war, Ukraine is fighting on the path to peace., Russia is shooting for destruction, Ukraine is shooting for survival. War is a national idea of the Russian Federation. The national idea of Ukraine is peace., And today I want to talk to you exactly about that, exactly about peace, not about war., For you - Japanese youth - war is something from books, movies, computer games. It is normal for you that Japanese soldiers do not die defending their own land, do not kill and do not encroach on foreign lands., Look around. What seems so ordinary and familiar to you is actually a huge blessing. The sky without missiles and bombs, houses and buildings - not destroyed and not damaged, loved ones and simply all your fellow citizens - not injured and alive. All this is a great blessing. And even more. All this is a ""miracle"" for us today., With weapons in our hands, we defend ourselves so that this miracle becomes a reality for us again. So simple and natural for human civilization. A normal state of affairs for a normal society and a normal country. It is not something incredible, fantastic or supernatural. It's just peace., And this is exactly what Ukraine is defending today. This is precisely the reason for the struggle and the goal of victory for us. Peace. For the sake of the future., To this end, we should all find answers to a number of questions. What will our world be like? Will the rule of force or the rule of law dominate it?, A world in which freedom, justice, human rights are the highest values? Or a world in which these values don't matter?, What will be the future of the UN and other international organizations - will they remain bureaucratized institutions with a closed ""club of the chosen ones"" like the Security Council unable to bring the aggressor to justice?, Or will they be reformatted into functional institutions capable of preventing wars, famine, and effectively combating climate change?, And finally, what should be the world's response to the threats of dictators with a ""nuclear stick""?, How should we rebuild cities from scratch so that they become new-conceptual in terms of simplicity, environmental friendliness and energy efficiency?, Can we use the Japanese experience of railway networks? How to get rid of energy dependence? What can we do for global food security? How to build a safe cyberspace?, What new technologies should be put into service for our citizens? How to make people's lives more comfortable?, Ladies and Gentlemen!, Dear professors, dear students!, The main goal of Ukraine is peace. Peace that is ordinary to you. Which was ordinary for us too, but everything changed in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and started hostilities in the east of Ukraine., And on February 24, 2022, when, in addition to the east, the aggression of the Russian Federation spread to the south, north, center and west, when a full-scale war covered all of Ukraine like a tsunami. Peace. What was the norm has become a memory. What is normal and remains the present for you. And what, I believe, will be the future for us all., Appreciate peace! Cherish the main benefit that gives you all other benefits: the opportunity to study, develop, create and live!, Cherish peace, defend peace, do not betray peace. You are capable of many things for the establishment and rule of peace. There is only one time when we can all serve peace in the whole world., And this time is now!, Thank you!, Glory to Ukraine!"
3 July 2022  - 22:46 ,Ukraine does not give anything up; we will return thanks to tactics and increasing the supply of modern weapons - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Ukrainians!, All our defenders!, Today, two important professional holidays are celebrated in our country: the Day of the Naval Forces of Ukraine and the Day of Anti-Aircraft Missile Troops. I sincerely congratulate all defenders of Ukraine who serve in these troops, I congratulate all veterans of the fleet, all veterans of anti-aircraft missile troops. Thanks to your service and your bravery, thousands of lives of our people have been saved., The Russian occupiers suffered very significant losses both at sea and in the sky. They have not had such losses for many decades. Thanks again for your service!, The main task of the state is to do everything for our heroes, our warriors from all branches of the army to have everything necessary for the defense of the state, to have the most modern weapons. It is not easy, it takes a lot of effort, it requires many negotiations, but we will ensure such a supply. Ukraine will reach the level when the fire superiority of the occupiers will be nullified. We are not losing a single day - we convince our partners, establish new connections, use all opportunities - political, diplomatic, information..., Today, the Russian army once again brutally shelled Slovyansk, Kramatorsk, Kharkiv with MLRS and ""Smerch"" systems. In Slovyansk alone, six people are on the list of dead, and about twenty are wounded. A girl died, her name was Yeva. She would have turned 10 in August this year..., Russia has enough Smerch, Uragan and Grad systems to destroy city after city in Ukraine. They have now accumulated their largest firepower in Donbas. And they can use tens of thousands of artillery shells every day on one section of the front. This is reality. That is why we destroy the potential of the occupiers - day after day, calculatedly, powerfully. And, of course, the HIMARS systems we received and other weapons from partners play an important role in this. The fact that we protect the lives of our soldiers, our people, plays an equally important role. We will rebuild the walls, we will regain the land, but people must be saved above all else., And if the command of our army withdraws people from certain points of the front where the enemy has the greatest fire superiority, in particular this applies to Lysychansk, it means only one thing: we will return thanks to our tactics, thanks to the increase in the supply of modern weapons., Ukraine does not give anything up. And when someone over there in Moscow reports something about the Luhansk region - let them remember their reports and promises before February 24, in the first days of this invasion, in the spring and now. Let them really evaluate what they got over this time and how much they paid for it. Because their current reports will turn into dust just as the previous ones. We are gradually moving forward - in the Kharkiv region, in the Kherson region and at sea: Zmiinyi is a good example of this. There will be a day when we will say the same about Donbas., The Prime Minister of Australia visited Kyiv today. A historical moment. And this is a very important visit. Australia is one of the top countries in terms of its level of support. We have already received significant defense assistance from it. Today, Mr. Prime Minister announced a new support package. I am grateful to him for that. Australia will also increase sanctions against Russia. This is the result of our constant activity, which increases the cost of this war for Russia., The Russian economy found itself in the biggest crisis in the last 50 years. The world severs ties with Russia. The words ""collapse"", ""deficit"" and ""poverty"" will be the description of Russian life as long as this state wants to be a terrorist state. , They lost more than 35 thousand soldiers, and this is a conservative estimate. What is all this for? For the sake of insane propagandists to be able to show a Russian or Soviet flag on the ruins somewhere in their broadcasts... There is simply no other answer., It is clear to everyone in the world – and, I am sure, to all the sane people in Russia itself – that Ukraine will win. It's only a matter of time. It is a matter, unfortunately, of the losses we suffer, primarily of people. It is a matter of modern weapons, which we must get and will definitely get., Tomorrow there will be a conference in Switzerland dedicated to the reconstruction of Ukraine. Today in Kyiv, I met with the President of the International Olympic Committee, and one of his initiatives is the convening of a special conference to raise funds for the restoration of Ukrainian sports infrastructure... These and many other international initiatives simply would not exist if the world doubted our victory., Therefore, we must continue focused work, fight and beat the occupiers until we regain our entire country. Ukraine will be free., I am grateful to everyone who defends the state!, Glory to Ukraine!"
2 July 2022  - 23:10 ,"In Lugano, Ukraine will present a national view of reconstruction; it is necessary to create a new basis for our life - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, We are actively preparing for the start of a special conference in Lugano, Switzerland. Its first day is on Monday. A large-scale international event dedicated to the reconstruction of our country. Reconstruction in the broad sense of the word. It is necessary not only to restore everything that the occupiers destroyed, but also to create a new basis for our life, for Ukraine - safe, modern, convenient, barrier-free. This requires colossal investments - billions, new technologies, best practices, new institutions and, of course, reforms., And already on Monday, Ukraine will present in Lugano a national view on how to implement all this., In fact, this is the largest economic project of our time in Europe and extraordinary opportunities for every state, for every company that we will invite to work in Ukraine to prove themselves., The territory of 10 regions was affected by hostilities after February 24. During this time, we managed to liberate 1,027 cities and towns, and another 2,610 are still under Russian occupation. And most of them need to be reconstructed, hundreds of them were completely destroyed by the Russian army, they actually have to be rebuilt from scratch. But besides that, dozens of cities in other regions of Ukraine were hit by missiles. Hundreds of enterprises were destroyed. Among them there are also complex, very dangerous industries - chemistry, metallurgy..., Of course, we have already begun to restore normal life in liberated communities and territories on our own. But implementing such a large-scale project across the country, providing new safety standards and a new quality of life is possible only by attracting international capabilities., Therefore, the Conference in Lugano can become an important step for the reconstruction of Ukraine. And when we implement this project - and I am sure that it will happen - this event might be considered its beginning., Although a lot still needs to be done for our victory - and it is a difficult path, because the war continues - but already now we must do everything possible so that the aggressor loses not only on the battlefield, but also historically, conceptually... So that everyone in Russia remembers that Ukraine cannot be broken by anything, by anyone, even by a brutal war., Today, the Russian army continued to fire missiles at our cities. As of the evening alone, there have already been six missile strikes, a total of 12 missiles. Mykolaiv, the Donetsk region... The airstrikes continued. Fierce hostilities continue along the entire frontline, in Donbas - the epicenter is, of course, in the cities of the Luhansk region. The enemy’s activity in the Kharkiv region is intensifying. We managed to oust the occupiers from Ivanivka, Kherson region, we continue to put pressure in the south of our country..., In many cities in the rear there is a feeling of relaxation now, but the war is not over - it goes on. Unfortunately, its cruelty is increasing in some places, and it cannot be forgotten. Therefore, help the army, help volunteers, help everyone who was left alone at this time. And constantly use all your contacts abroad, all your information opportunities - even just social networks to spread the truth about the war and about the crimes of the occupiers on our land., Tomorrow and during the week there will be important negotiations and meetings for Ukraine - we do not reduce diplomatic activity for a single day. We also expect new decisions from partners regarding defense assistance to our state..., The main thing, no matter how difficult it is for us today, we must remember that there will be tomorrow. And tomorrow should bring maximum benefit to Ukraine - everyone should do absolutely everything possible for this., I am thankful to all our defenders!, You are doing great! You are strong!, Glory to Ukraine!"
1 July 2022  - 23:27 ,"The United States announced a new support package for Ukraine, which includes powerful NASAMS systems that will significantly strengthen our air defense - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Ukrainians! , All our defenders!, In the Odesa region, the dismantling of rubble after the Russian missile attack on Serhiivka is underway. Three missiles hit an ordinary residential building, a nine-story building in which no one hid any weapons, military equipment or ammunition, as Russian propagandists and officials always tell about such strikes. It was a simple house, about 160 people. It was inhabited by ordinary people, civilians. The recreation center was also destroyed by this strike - an absolutely typical object for the seaside area., I emphasize: this is a deliberate, purposeful Russian terror, not some mistakes or an accidental missile strike. Four people from one family were killed... The murdered boy, 12 years old, whose name was Dmytro... As of now, there are 21 people on the list of the dead, and about 40 are wounded. The numbers have been changing all day, unfortunately, the death toll is increasing., Simultaneously with the missiles at Serhiivka, missiles were fired at Zatoka. 12 missiles hit Mykolaiv at once - various objects in the city. It's only one night and morning... My condolences to all relatives, loved ones of all whose lives were taken by such strikes., I am especially grateful to the United States of America and personally to Biden for the new support package for Ukraine announced today, which includes very powerful NASAMS systems. An anti-aircraft missile complex that will significantly strengthen our air defense. We have worked hard for this supply. In total, this package is worth 820 million dollars and, in addition to NASAMS, also includes artillery munition and radars., We are no less actively negotiating about other new weapons from our partners - it is necessary for Donbas, the Kharkiv region, the south of Ukraine. We are doing everything to break the advantage of the occupiers., The Prime Minister of Norway visited Kyiv today. We discussed the further defense support for Ukraine, the strengthening of sanctions against Russia. Norway has already given us significant support, but there will be an additional package of 1 billion euros. Thank you so much. We will not forget., A special Group on International Security Guarantees for Ukraine was formed. The Group is headed by Anders Fogh Rasmussen, ex-Secretary General of NATO (he arrived in Kyiv today). Head of my Office Andriy Yermak will also work with him., The Group included influential figures from various democratic countries of the world - Australia, USA, Sweden, Great Britain, Germany, Poland, France, Italy and, of course, Ukraine. The main task of the Group is to develop a format of security guarantees for our country, which will really work and work long-term, so that there are no future aggressions., We are increasing Ukraine's foreign policy ties with Latin America. I held talks with the leaders of Argentina and Chile. Ukraine's interests will be represented everywhere in the world., Despite the war, despite all threats, we do not stop our movement towards the European Union. Today in the Verkhovna Rada, I signed a statement on European integration together with the Chairman and our Prime Minister. We have specified with this document that we are starting to move from candidate status to full membership., I am grateful to President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen who expressed clear support for Ukraine in her address to the Verkhovna Rada today. We will not waste time. I believe that Ukraine will be able to gain membership as energetically as we gained candidacy., I am grateful to everyone who helps our country today, I am grateful to everyone who defends our country., Glory to Ukraine!"
1 July 2022  - 11:43 ,European integration of Ukraine is a guarantee of a free and prosperous life for all generations of our people - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the plenary session of the Verkhovna Rada,", Dear Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada,, Dear Prime Minister,, Dear people's deputies,, Ladies and Gentlemen!, A new history of Ukraine and the European Union has begun. We are now not next to each other, but together. Not two neighbors between which there are borders and barriers, but one European family that has common values and a common destiny., And it's not just words, it's not declarative, it's not some kind of hope or political calculation, it's a legally fixed status. Ukraine has gained the status of a candidate for joining the European Union., 115 days between the submission of the Ukrainian application for accession and the response of the European Union is a record short period. We were united just as for our defense. We acted in unity just as for the protection of our state, our land. We did not stop for a moment until the European Council adopted a positive decision, just as we will not stop for a moment until we win., We are aware that the European integration of Ukraine is a guarantee to all generations of our people of a free and prosperous life based on the best human values. And that is why it is an honor and a great responsibility for each and every one of us to participate in the realization of the European aspirations of our state., What is 115 days? These are hundreds of negotiations: meetings, phone conversations, hundreds of events, rallies, concerts in support of Ukraine and our candidacy, hundreds of decisions adopted. These are hundreds of updated procedures and thousands of pages of a perfectly filled questionnaire that we received from the European Commission. All this was not easy, but we did it. Congratulations to you!, We have created an extremely strong foundation that no one can destroy and on which we can make our European future our present., Ukraine is fighting for its choice of values: to be an independent state in a large family, in a free family, a new state in a European family. Ukrainians have to defend their independence with weapons in hands. The safety of each of our people. To prevent such tragic Ukrainian mornings as today's - with a Russian missile attack on Odesa and the region, with numerous victims. And to make Ukrainian mornings as peaceful as the mornings of every European capital - now, in the XXI century., And I really want all civil servants today to perceive their duty to work for the sake of the European choice as a struggle for our state, a struggle for Ukraine, for ourselves., We have to prepare the state for the start of negotiations on membership as intensively and as responsibly as we prepared the decision on candidacy., Today, the flag of the European Union will appear in this hall. And it should not just be a beautiful gesture. Not just a symbol. This should be a symbol of our task - the task of all of us, of all branches of government. So that there are no pauses in our work. So that every decision necessary for Ukraine's European path is adopted. And so that these are the decisions the positive effect of which will be felt by Ukrainian society, Ukrainian families and Ukrainian citizens., Gaining membership in the European Union is not only geopolitics or the realization of political aspirations. These are specific things, specific advantages that benefit the life of every person, every company, every state institution., Only recently, the transport visa-free regime and aviation visa-free regime have been implemented. We have got the most free access to the European market - without duties and quotas. We have joined the common European energy network and are now able to export electricity to the countries of the European Union. These are revolutionary decisions for our economy and our state. The next steps are the customs visa-free regime, digital visa-free regime - i.e. Ukraine’s accession to the Digital Europe Programme. We have to significantly speed up the work on the industrial visa-free regime. And of course, we have to achieve a decision on the abolition of roaming charges between Ukraine and the countries of the European Union on a permanent basis., The European path is just such decisions. Each of them strengthens our state, each of you. Together, they create new opportunities for the whole of Europe - thanks to the realization of Ukrainian potential. Europe is becoming stronger together with Ukraine!, Many decisions will depend precisely on the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, on each of the deputies. On the extent to which you, dear people's deputies, are ready to work for this path. And on the extent to which government officials will work in coordination with you and our diplomacy. The Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union is already 63% implemented, and 37% remain tasks for all of us, for our state. But you still have to elaborate, defend in front of your colleagues and pass dozens of important bills. It won't be easy either. However, there is no alternative. Even if you know that you will not get applause with this or that decision, if the decision is necessary for this difficult, important European path of our country, you must adopt such decisions., Today, we are signing a joint statement, which is a signal of the unity of all branches of government and evidence of our determination to achieve the strategic goal of Ukraine, namely: full membership in the European Union. And signing this statement should mean the same as signing the application for entry - on the fifth day of the war. We have been going towards candidacy for 115 days. And our path to membership must not take years, decades. We have to cover this path quickly. To what extent it is possible is up to us. We have to do our part of the job ideally to enable our friends in the European Union to make another historic decision for us just as quickly, in the same consolidated manner., Dear Mr. Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada and Dear Mr. Prime Minister,, Dear attendees,, Today I want to thank every European nation and every leader who stood ""for"" the candidacy for our state. There have probably never been so many negotiations in such a short period of time. But all these negotiations were substantive, all of them were thought out, sometimes they were not easy. And I want to thank everyone present, our Cabinet of Ministers. Thank you. I am thankful to each and every one. It's really hard work, which turned out to be successful in the end., And a great personal contribution to this success was made by great friends of Ukraine, who are and, I am sure, will be our great friends - President of the European Council Charles Michel and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen., And today I have the honor to invite the President of the European Commission to deliver a speech in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. Ursula, I wish to thank you once again for your leadership in building these powerful and strong historical relations between Ukraine and Europe, which have become our new history, the new common European history of Ukraine., Glory to Ukraine!"
1 July 2022  - 08:03 ,We are obliged to win the war unleashed by Russia for the hopes of all nations for a peaceful future to be realized - address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the 4Gamechangers festival in Vienna,", Dear Mr. Federal President,, Dear Mr. Federal Chancellor,, Dear moderators!, Ladies and Gentlemen!, Dear attendees and all people who watch us in different countries of our wonderful world!, Thank you for the invitation to participate in your forum. Gamechanging is really something that can be said about Ukraine, and it is quite logical that such a forum takes place with our participation., And I immediately want to draw your attention to one fact, very important, in my opinion. Over the years, there have been many different discussions about what our lives could become. People argued for a long time about what should be changed and what can be changed. But now, for the first time in many, many years or even decades, the changes speak for themselves. This is the fact. You don't have to look for them anymore. No more discussions, no more arguments. Everyone can just see what needs to be done. Done immediately!, Just look at what is happening. Look at how easily one state created a threat, a large-scale threat, a dangerous wave for many, many others. For example, the threat of large-scale famine. Russia blocked the Black Sea - it's no secret, and it is now keeping millions of people hostage, ordinary people in Africa, Asia, Europe. We are all hostages. You are its hostages. Because if this threat of hunger is not removed, if the Black Sea is not unblocked immediately, the food crisis will result in such a migration tsunami that will reach even you, although Austria is pretty far from the sea., Look at how much one state has been able to do to spread dangerous conspiracy theories and aggressive propaganda. What kind of trust in mass media will we be able to talk about over time, if Russia continues to spend billions of dollars annually to spread lies, and these lies remain in the information space even of the European Union?, Please take a look at the cyber attacks that Ukraine, Lithuania, and other countries have suffered. Russia supports cybercriminals whose only mission is to destroy security. I'm sure you're all aware of how big corporations disregard people's right to privacy and appropriate a lot of data about each individual. But... What can you oppose it with when the largest state in the world does this and even much worse?, And just look at the prices of fuel, gas, etc. What is happening to them? Markets are too dependent on Russian companies, Gazprom and Russian oil suppliers. And therefore, the wallets of Europeans are too dependent on how much one state wants to extract from them., One state cannot break the lives of everyone in Europe or even in the whole world! This game needs to change!, How many years have we been talking about the fact that Europe should not depend on Russian energy resources? And this year, it is necessary to do it in time so that the next winter does not become catastrophic., How many years have we been talking about the fact that Russia spends dollars and euros from oil and gas against the West itself, against the entire community of democratic countries? It is a sponsor of divisions and disinformation, anti-European political movements and problems for the entire continent. This flow of money used against the democratic world must stop this year. Otherwise, everyone in the world who hates democracy will understand that the democratic world cannot defend itself., And about the war. You know, war is said to be the continuation of politics by other means. If we talk about the Russian war against Ukraine, then it is really so. This is a continuation of Russia's long-standing anti-European politics, and every Russian occupier on Ukrainian soil is aware of this. But did everyone truly realize this, everyone in Europe, in the European Union?, Ladies and Gentlemen!, Ukrainian gamechanging is in the fact that we give a chance to do what should have been done a long time ago., Strengthen European unity as much as possible. Eliminate Europe’s dependence on Russian energy resources. Maximize support for free mass media that work according to journalistic standards, so that there is something to protect the truth from propaganda, and therefore from lies, conspiracy theories and anti-scientific theories. Create effective common European tools for protection against cyber threats. And of course it is vitally necessary to reinforce international law with a real punishment for its violation., The eyes of all aggressive political movements and regimes in the world are now focused on what Russia is doing against us, against Ukraine. They are waiting to see whether Russian officials and military commanders will pay for what they are doing on the territory of Ukraine. Whether the world will be able to bring war criminals to real justice. If the answer is positive, it will be a strong foundation for peace on earth in the future. If not, if hundreds of treaties and conventions violated by Russia remain mere pieces of paper, humanity will have to deal with hundreds of other aggressions., Ukraine gives this chance to take the necessary steps. Ukraine gives time in order to take these steps in time. We are obliged to win the war unleashed by Russia for the hopes of all normal people for a peaceful progressive future to be realized., Is it possible without the help of Austria? I don’t think so., I am grateful to your state for the support., Is our joint victory possible without powerful sanctions, which should be strengthened regularly so that the terrorist state does not have time to adapt to them? No. And I ask you to redouble your activity in the preparation of these sanctions, in the preparation of the seventh package of European Union sanctions., Only at this time, only in these months, only this year the necessary steps can be taken., Either the game will change in favor of Europe, or the enemies of democracy and freedom will believe that the game can change in their favor. We have to do it in time!, Thank you for your attention!, Glory to Ukraine!"
