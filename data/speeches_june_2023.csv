30 June 2023  - 19:45 ,Ukraine and Ukrainians are much stronger than anyone thinks about us – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Dear Ukrainians, good health to you!, I held a Supreme Commander-in-Chief's Staff meeting today – a long and very detailed one devoted to several issues. The commanders reported both on the general defense situation, and the specific directions of our defense and our offensive actions., During this day, we also have made progress in all directions of our active actions., We considered the supply of rounds for artillery – for the east, for the south - at the Staff meeting. And although our work with partners to receive rounds for Ukrainian soldiers is already at our best capacity, we will make it even more active. Strengthening our artillery is an obvious priority, and all foreign affairs specialists received additional tasks today., The situation in the north, in particular, on the territory of Belarus, was considered separately. Our intelligence reported today – Defense Intelligence, foreign intelligence, border guards intelligence. The SSU chief reported. We very carefully analyze every fact and any prospects in all directions., By the decision of the Staff, Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny and General Naev were instructed to strengthen the northern direction – to guarantee peace. Appropriate deadlines are set., Today, I thank Denmark and personally Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen for the new defense package for Ukraine. Artillery rounds, air defense missiles, demining equipment... Thank you!, I also held several meaningful preparatory meetings today regarding the internal context in our state, relevant internal measures, and international measures – an extremely important period of foreign policy is beginning. The work in order to expand peace through expanding our security capabilities, our alliances and cooperation. The following weeks will be extremely active, and the positions of our state are clearly defined, all our officials know what to do., And one more., Today is the first anniversary of the liberation of Snake Island from the Russian invaders. It is one of our major victories. Remember, last year, in the spring, no one expected from Ukraine that we would be able to implement, in particular, this fundamental defense task – to provide security to Snake Island, and therefore to a significant part of the Black Sea water area. But our soldiers did it. Russian terrorists needed Snake Island to destroy the entire south of our country, our beautiful Odesa and other cities. Our soldiers stopped them and drove them out of Snake Island., Ukraine and Ukrainians are much stronger than anyone thinks about us. Sometimes, stronger than we are used to thinking about ourselves. Thanks to all that our people manage to do in the confrontation with Russian terrorists, we are revealing to the whole world and to ourselves a new Ukrainian strength – a real Ukrainian strength. The strength that we will never lose and that will always be a pillar of the security of the free world., I am grateful to everyone who freed Snake Island! Defense Intelligence, together with other elements of the Defense and Security Forces of our country, conducted this operation. Defense Intelligence and the SSU Alpha special unit, the Naval Forces and the army aviation of the Ground Forces Command, the Air Force aviation and our strong border guards. Thank you!, And we will always remember our heroes, our soldiers, who gave their lives for the sake of this Ukrainian victory. Among those whose names can now be mentioned... Defense Intelligence fighters – Ruslan Popov, Hero of Ukraine, captain of the 1st rank; Oleh Zaitsev, Hero of Ukraine, junior lieutenant; Vitaliy Ihnatenko, Hero of Ukraine, soldier. SSU Alpha fighters – Volodymyr Kyseliov, Hero of Ukraine, captain; Oleksandr Krykunenko, Hero of Ukraine, major. Soldiers of the Navy - Ihor Bedzai, Hero of Ukraine, colonel; as well as Mykhailo Zaremba, major; Serhiy Muschytsky, captain; Yuriy Pyroh, staff sergeant. Eternal memory!, Eternal memory and glory to all those who gave their lives so that our beautiful Ukraine would live!, Glory to Ukraine!"
29 June 2023  - 22:25 ,"Combating ecocide is one of the points of the Ukrainian Peace Formula, and we must implement each of its points - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", I wish you health, dear Ukrainians!, I am finishing the day in the Verkhovna Rada with a meeting with our Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk. We are working., And now the report on this day, a busy day. A very long one., The European Council meeting - it is already a tradition for Ukraine to be among the members of the European Union. The agenda is obvious: our defense in this war, our path to victory, support from our partners, our security support for them, for our entire Europe. Ukraine influences the strength of Europe. This is a fact. And this year, it is time to use this and other similar facts to strengthen unity in Europe, including by starting negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union., The meeting with Mike Pence, the 48th Vice President of the United States, Senator... American support for Ukraine is vital - from all Americans, every American family, all U.S. civil society, all political leaders, Congress - both parties, of course, from President Biden. Thank you for this support!, I discussed with Mr. Pence our defense, our cooperation - from the very beginning, from the very first days between the Ukrainian and American nations. We talked about weapons, about the capabilities of our soldiers, about our common values., The meeting with the members of the International Working Group on the Environmental Consequences of War - Greta Thunberg, Margot Wallström and others. We talked primarily about the Russian terrorist attack and ecocide at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant and the work of our group, which will deal with issues directly related to the destructive impact of Russian aggression on nature. Combating ecocide is one of the points of the Ukrainian Peace Formula, and we must implement each of its points, all aspects of peace., The conversation with the President of Guatemala. The Peace Formula, our cooperation with Latin America, assistance in demining, and most importantly, in establishing a Tribunal for Russian aggression., The meeting with our business representatives - very important, very meaningful. I am grateful to them. We discussed how to stimulate economic activity now, in times of war. We talked about how to provide more protection for business, more interaction between the state and business. The first priority now is defense, and this is obvious. But the economy is also important., I am grateful to everyone who works for Ukraine, for Ukrainians, who preserves and creates new jobs, who pays taxes and who is already preparing for our recovery, for the large-scale transformation program of Ukraine that we will definitely implement after our victory., And, of course, our warriors, our defense. Today, in my address to the Chatham House community - one of the world's leading British intellectual centers - I told that three more very important decrees have been prepared to award our warriors - 419 warriors. In total, over 49,000 Ukrainians have already been awarded state awards during the full-scale war!, I am grateful to each and every one who defends our country! I thank all those who are in combat now, who also gave us the best news today - the advancement of Ukrainian positions. Glory to you, our heroes! I thank everyone in the world who really helps us!, Glory to Ukraine!"
29 June 2023  - 22:01 ,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Chatham House 2022 Award Ceremony: This award for Ukraine is another proof that the world believes in our country, Ukrainians and our victory",", Dear friends!, I am grateful for your attention to Ukraine and your respect for Ukraine. , Ukrainian soldiers, all our beautiful people really deserve the highest honors. Millions of our people fight and work for our freedom, our common freedom – Ukrainian and all free nations. I am sure that we will keep our freedom. And your award, in particular... The Chatham House Prize for Ukraine is another proof that the world believes in Ukraine, believes in Ukrainians, believes in our victory., , Ladies and Gentlemen!, Thousands and thousands of our warriors distinguished themselves in battles against the invaders. Today, my advisors prepared three new decrees on awarding state awards to our heroes. At once to 419 of our warriors, men and women, who are fighting for freedom with their blood, pain, loss of their brothers in arms. , I want you to know that every day we have success on the frontline thanks to our heroic soldiers! And, of course, thanks to the support of our partners – and the United Kingdom is one of the obvious leaders in this support. Thank you very much!, Every day our soldiers repel Russian assaults, step by step they liberate our land and people, every day we make Russian tyranny weaker – as it should be for our world to be safe. During the full-scale war, more than 49 thousand of our soldiers are awarded with state awards for bravery in battles. 245 soldiers are awarded with the title of the Hero of Ukraine. Imagine how intense the fighting is and how strong our people are! Such a number of well-deserved awards for special bravery and courage reflects the mass bravery and courage of Ukrainians. , , Please always support our people – they deserve it. And I believe, that – the day will come very, very soon when Ukrainian contribution to the global freedom and the strength of our people will be recognized by a legitimate recognition of our state – an ally of your state and all free nations, NATO members. , We must honestly admit: peace in Europe is the Alliance. So that aggression against one or another European nation never repeats again and so that such self-sacrifice of soldiers is never needed again, security institutions, in particular Euro-Atlantic institutions, must really protect peace. And now it is real – only together with Ukraine. Which will be free, strong and, of course, in NATO. Only together with our heroes., Glory to all Ukrainian heroes! Thank you again for this day. Thank you for your support! Thank you, United Kingdom!, Слава Україні!"
29 June 2023  - 19:02 ,This is a historic time to start negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union - speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the meeting of the European Council,", Dear Charles, dear colleagues!, Thank you very much, greetings to you all and thank you for inviting me!, I started this week with a visit to the frontline. Two of our regions – Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia. Most of the combat operations, both offensive and defensive, are concentrated there. The fighting is highly intensive there, and our people are outstanding heroes! Our soldiers are doing a great job, and I am proud of them, every one of them who is now on the ground, fending-off Russian attacks and destroying Russian terrorists. We manage to liberate our land and people from the occupiers, and this is the most important thing., The more successful our soldiers are now, the longer Russia will not pose a threat to Ukraine and our entire Europe. History clearly demonstrates that unsuccessful aggressions always make dictatorships weak. In fact, this is what we are seeing in Russia right now – we are seeing their weakness, which we so badly need. The weaker Russia is, and the more its bosses fear mutinies and uprisings, the more they will fear to irritate us. Russia's weakness will make it safe for others, and its defeat will solve the problem of this war., , Dear colleagues, partners!, I am grateful to all of you who’re helping our defense against Russian aggression! Thank you for every air defense system provided to us – they do save lives. It’s true. Thank you for the European initiative on a million shells and rounds for Ukraine, for our tank coalition and for all the defense packages that have been provided to our country. This is truly historic cooperation for the defense of Europe. Ukraine is grateful to Lithuania and Poland, and we will not allow Russia or its terrorist groups to even try to undermine the security of the Lithuanian and Polish people from the territory of Belarus. For Ukraine, the security of our partners is also our security. , Yesterday, Mr. President Nausėda and Mr. President Duda visited Ukraine, and we exchanged assessments of the situation in Belarus and the challenges it presents. Ukraine's position is absolutely clear – any attempt to blackmail Europe, any attempt to do something against Europe should be treated equally by the whole Europe. If someone somewhere threatens one or another European nation, it is absolutely natural to stand up for that nation and eliminate the threat., Another important thing to mention in the context of security is sanctions. I am grateful for the recently adopted eleventh sanctions package of the European Union, which continues the fair policy of pressure on everyone who makes aggression possible. It is important not to stop imposing sanctions. The fewer pauses there are, the less Russia will adapt to the pressure on it and the less it will think of ways to circumvent the sanctions. I am grateful that the eleventh sanctions package pays attention to Russia's attempts to circumvent sanctions through third countries, and this attention should be strengthened in the twelfth EU sanctions package. Many of the missiles that Russian terrorists are now using against life in Ukraine are newly produced and contain critical components made by companies in the free world. This cannot be tolerated. Together we must stop Russia's use of free world technologies for aggression against freedom., We also cannot tolerate what Russia is doing to our Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Let me remind you, that – this is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Russian terrorists have mined it – we have specific information from our intelligence, and we have presented it, in particular, to diplomats of European countries. As well as information about Russia's use of foreign parts for missile production. The Russian nuclear industry deserves sanctions in response to Russian radiation blackmail., , Dear colleagues!, Tomorrow, the Swedish presidency comes to an end, and I would like to thank Sweden and personally Prime Minister Kristersson for their effective work. Over these six months, Europe has become stronger. I’m sure of it. On behalf of all Ukrainians, I want to thank you, dear leaders, and you, Charles, you, Ursula, you, Roberta, for making important economic and political decisions that help us defend our freedom and Europe., Unfortunately, there are things that do not help us. But, if solidarity continues to work, if our security and economic cooperation is not broken by artificial and illegal restrictions, if Europe's long-term and principled decisions continue to send signals to the world that Europe believes in peace, then this war will definitely not drag on., I am grateful for the extension of our free trade with Europe and transit for another year. Every manifestation of solidarity, every manifestation of unity is now lifesaving. I am grateful for the proposal of a long-term financial instrument of the EU in the amount of 50 billion euros announced by the President of the European Commission von der Leyen, and if this proposal is approved, it will be the right signal that Europe believes in peace, believes in Ukraine. It is very important that the European Parliament always gives principled assessments of what is happening, and immediately condemned the Russian terrorist attack on the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. This attack led to the largest ecocide in Europe in decades, and those responsible must be held accountable. It is important that the European Council also condemn this horrific Russian terrorist attack and ecocide at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. , I would like to note that if there is no strong reaction from European leaders and countries to the Russian crime at the Kakhovka HPP, it may give Russian terrorists more arrogance with regard to the Zaporizhzhia NPP. And, in any case, it is destructive when Russia uses a nuclear power plant for radiation blackmail and at the same time discusses the construction of new nuclear units with EU member states. How can we trust a terrorist to build nuclear units? Sorry, but it’s a rhetorical question., And finally, a few thoughts on the next six months for Europe. , I believe it is symbolic that this Saturday, on the first day of Spain's presidency, Mr. Sanchez, the Prime Minister of Spain, will visit Ukraine at my invitation. For the first time, the beginning of a country's presidency will be emphasized by a visit to Ukraine. And this actually says a lot about how important the next six months will be for our Europe. This is a historic time to start negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the EU. A Europe of values, a free and strong Europe, a Europe of peace is unthinkable without Ukraine. We are ready to start accession negotiations, and our progress in implementing the European Commission's recommendations has to be fixed. Ukraine is determined to be fully prepared for the start of accession negotiations as soon as possible, and we will do so., Peace has no alternatives. So, maximum unity in Europe has no alternatives., Thank you very much for your attention! Thank you for your support, friends!, Слава Україні!"
28 June 2023  - 22:49 ,Russia and its accomplices must feel that the price of their terror will only increase for them - address by the President of Ukraine,", Dear Ukrainians!, First of all, regarding yesterday's Russian attack on Kramatorsk. Today, work continued all day at the site of the attack. Unfortunately, the death toll has increased. Russian missiles claimed the lives of 11 of our people, including three children. My condolences to the families. More than 60 people were injured and wounded., Today, the Security Service of Ukraine together with the police special forces detained the person who coordinated this terrorist attack. They hit an ordinary cafe in Kramatorsk, a popular pizzeria. Neighboring houses, shops, and a gas station were damaged. An ordinary city, an ordinary life. There may still be people under the rubble., Everyone who helps Russian terrorists destroy life deserves the maximum punishment. And this applies not only to some collaborators. Everything is clear about them. These are people without humanity. Anyone in the world who does not understand that one cannot be an accomplice of a terrorist state must be held accountable by the entire international community. The spotter is being charged with treason. The possible punishment is life imprisonment. Accomplices of a terrorist state must be treated as betrayers of humanity., We will continue our work to strengthen international sanctions against Russia and its accomplices. They must feel that the price of their terror will only increase for them. And we will continue our global legal work to ensure that international instruments work in one way or another to punish all Russian terrorists and the aggressor state itself., Today, in my address to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on the occasion of Constitution Day, I spoke, in particular, about justice. I spoke about internal justice, which is about accountability for violations of law in Ukraine. And about justice in relation to the Russian-Ukrainian war - about Russia's accountability for war crimes. The policy of justice will be one of the foundations of the Ukrainian Doctrine, a fundamental document that will determine the course of our country for decades., We need such a document. Everyone in Ukraine, all our neighbors, everyone in the world should know what our national goal is, what we consider to be the end of this war, and how we are going to live after this war. No matter what the occupiers try to do against us and no matter what kind of terror they use, they will not be able to break Ukraine. They will not succeed in knocking us off the path that leads the occupiers to accountability for everything they have done against us and that leads us to our guaranteed security and lasting freedom., Ukraine and everyone in the world who stands with us in defense of freedom will also stand in defense of justice. Justice for all those whose lives were taken by Russian terror, whose fate was broken by the Russian war. Eternal memory to all our people, to all Ukrainian children who were killed by Russian savages!, I would like to briefly report on the day., The Presidents of Lithuania and Poland, Gitanas Nausėda and Andrzej Duda, paid a visit., A very timely and useful visit on the eve of Vilnius. The format of the talks was both joint and bilateral. Weapons for Ukraine. By the way, thank you, Gitanas, Mr. President, for the decision to purchase and transfer NASAMS systems to Ukraine, as it is very much needed. We discussed common political challenges in the entire region and between our countries. Of course, we also talked about the launch of negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union, which we expect to happen this year., I met with Chief Master Sergeant of the 47th separate mechanized brigade ""Magura"" Valerii Markus. We talked about the war, our warriors, and our defense., We also discussed the reform of record keeping in military structures. Less paperwork and bureaucracy, more digitalization. We discussed the reform of the sergeant corps. It was a good conversation. Thank you for the chevrons!, Today, on the Constitution Day of Ukraine, I had the honor to award our warriors and hand over state awards to the families of our heroes. It was very emotional, very honorable. I am proud of our warriors! I am grateful for everything and for the saved life of Ukraine!, Congratulations to everyone on Constitution Day and, most importantly, I wish us all, each and every one in our country, to multiply freedom, glory and independence of Ukraine! And so it will be!, I also congratulate all Muslims of Ukraine and the world on the beginning of Kurban Bayram. May we all achieve peace for our country, for our countries, for our children. A fair and just peace., I thank everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine! I am grateful to each and every one who is now in combat, at combat posts and in positions. Thank you, warriors, for your new advancement!, Glory to Ukraine!"
28 June 2023  - 17:07 ,The victorious Ukraine will be a country worthy of its heroes - President's speech at the plenary session of the Verkhovna Rada on the occasion of the 27th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution,", Glory to Ukraine!, With these words – ""Glory to Ukraine"" – our brave heroes, courageous Ukrainians on the frontline look the enemy in the eye – with dignity, confidence, and perseverance. They defend lives for Ukraine. They give their lives for Ukraine., Thanks to these words, the whole world hears and knows that here in Europe, on the eastern flank of our continent, a global center of courage has emerged. A center that will never allow freedom to be destroyed - neither of our own, nor of our allies and partners., , And it is an honor to say these words: ""Glory to Ukraine""., It is an honor to be Ukrainian. It is an honor to gain glory for Ukraine. And it is an honor that obliges. It obliges us to win and build a victorious Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!, And we will do it! We will. All of us together! Each and every person who fights and works for our state, for our people. We will do it! Millions of Ukrainians – the modern generations of our people, whom history has blessed with the opportunity to realize the dreams of Ukrainian heroes of different times who fought for freedom and independence for Ukraine and for justice for all of us, for all Ukrainians., Everything depends on us now, and Ukraine will be a victorious state!,  , Dear Ukrainian people! , Everyone present in this hall of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine!, The courage of our people has given Ukraine the moral leadership that inspires and unites the nations of the world. The Ukrainian aspiration to live freely and the heroism of our people have cleansed universal values from the age-old stain of cynicism and cowardice. Different nations have joined us in the fight for freedom, and not only because the world loves the brave. Whether the nations of the world will have peace and whether humanity will survive on earth depends on how we end this war and on whether the lives of the victorious Ukrainians will affirm freedom in the same way as the struggle for it., Just as we have already shown that courage gives freedom, we will prove that freedom gives success. We will make it a Ukrainian axiom: freedom gives success. This is what convinces the most. Success. This is what our entire land needs. Each and every one of us. All our people. All parts of Ukraine, all children of Ukraine., But for this success to happen, the Ukrainian state needs to be transformed. And we will make the transformation that Ukrainians have dreamed of a reality!, I would like to quote the words of a Ukrainian soldier. His name is Maksym Nahornyi. He was born in 2004. He is an orphan. He serves Ukraine in the 14th Roman the Great mechanized brigade. Here are Maksym's words: ""I witnessed terrible things that I want to forget, not to recall, to erase from my memory, just like yesterday of this damn war, but what will happen tomorrow? There is no need to rebuild the old system - let's create a new and much better Ukraine!"", These words of Ukrainian soldier Nahornyi deserve our support., 27 years ago, the Constitution of our country was adopted in this hall of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. And I congratulate you today on the Constitution Day of Ukraine! Our beautiful Ukraine, which, despite everything, retains its free soul and is governed by its people, not by the arbitrariness of certain individuals., In 27 years, Ukraine has gone through two revolutions and preserved its democracy and Europeanness. 8 years of hybrid war in Donbas - and Ukraine has preserved its dignity and faith in the future. 490 days of full-scale Russian aggression. 490 days - and each of our soldiers, all our people believe in the Ukrainian future and already decide what they want this future to look like., As the Constitution lays the foundations, we need a Doctrine for our state. A clear, unambiguous, bold Doctrine. For Ukraine, which is on its way to victory. And for the victorious Ukraine. This Doctrine should answer all the fundamental questions about Ukraine and our future for ourselves, our neighbors, and everyone in the world., We need a new system, new rules, new opportunities., Unfortunately, for a very long time, state institutions in Ukraine and representatives of the state have treated our people and life in Ukraine in general with cruelty, disdain, and rapaciousness, to be honest. Like a bad stepmother or like an orphanage from which you want to escape. Unfortunately, behind the poverty, corruption, and injustice in Ukraine, the world did not notice our courage and freedom-loving spirit. When the world talked about Ukraine, it was more about the state institutions and facts of life in our country that needed to be corrected, not about heroes who deserved to be emulated., Even before this Russian-Ukrainian war, we embarked on a path of change. February 24, 2022 was Russia's attempt not only to kill our independence and not only to erase our identity, but also to destroy our example - the example that a state of Ukraine's size and complicated history can succeed in becoming a strong and prosperous democracy that convinces other nations in the region and the world to live freely, not in submission to anyone., In all its efforts, Russia will lose. And this is no longer a dream, it is a reality., Even now, despite the war, we continue to follow the path of change. And I am confident that the first day of peace after this war, the first day of our well-deserved victory, will also be the first day of further rapid transformation of Ukraine. The foundations of our life. Our institutions, economic practices, social habits, policies and everyday life. What we cannot change now, in the conditions of war, we will change in the process of our recovery and transformation. We will create a new and much stronger Ukraine!,  , Dear Ukrainian people!, We will determine together what victorious Ukraine should become. Just as we defend freedom and independence together. It will be fair., The Constitution of Ukraine stipulates that the President of Ukraine is the guarantor of state sovereignty, territorial integrity of Ukraine and observance of the Constitution of Ukraine, human and civil rights and freedoms. The President of Ukraine is the guarantor of our country's strategic European and Euro-Atlantic course., In pursuance of these provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine, I would like to propose today for discussion, a nationwide discussion, the main guidelines for the future Ukrainian Doctrine. We need a common vision of what the victorious Ukraine should be like., We have the Day of Statehood up ahead, and then the Independence Day, and I think it is right to consider these days as stages for elaborating the points of the Ukrainian Doctrine., As a result of discussions here in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, in each of our communities, in the media, on educational, public and various business platforms in Ukraine, we will develop and then approve the text of the Ukrainian Doctrine at a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine., And very importantly... I would like to address our warriors, our Ukrainian heroes of this great generation. All Ukrainian soldiers and sailors, sergeants, foremen, officers, all generals... First, I ask everyone present in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine to express gratitude to all our heroes with a minute of applause., Recently, I visited the positions of our troops in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions. I talked to commanders and soldiers. I had the honor to present the awards - it is a great honor. I was honored to hug our warriors and exchange emotions and thoughts., Today, about a million of our people serve in the Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine. In combat brigades and other units, hundreds of thousands of defenders are fighting for us, for Ukraine., And no one has the right to determine the fate of Ukraine without asking them, our heroes., We communicate with our warriors. We read them on social media. We see your aspirations, warriors! Everyone who was on the frontline saw that our warriors know what they are fighting for. And I ask each and every member of the Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine - as far as the conditions of war allow - to take part in our national discussion on the Ukrainian Doctrine., Freedom is a child of care, and security is a brother of courage. The victorious Ukraine will be a country worthy of its heroes!,  , Dear Ukrainians!, , Today, I propose five, in my opinion, main guidelines for discussion and the beginning of a nationwide debate on the Ukrainian Doctrine. These are directions that can be supplemented by certain specific points that the nation will consider important. , So, here are five main guidelines for the Ukrainian Doctrine for discussion:, The first is the philosophy of our victory. , The second is the global nature of Ukrainian security. , The third is the policy of heroes. , The fourth is the policy of justice. , The fifth is transformation in 10 years, namely a new foreign policy. A new economy. New relations between the state and society. Development of all our territories. Education and science. Culture. The level of security and freedom in Ukraine as a precondition and result of transformation., Let's start with the main thing - our victory., When we talk about Ukraine's victory in this war for freedom and independence, we say it specifically: Ukraine's victory is the liberation of our entire territory from Russian occupation. We will not leave a single part of Ukraine to the enemy! Ukraine's victory means the expulsion of all Russian military formations, mercenaries and militants from the entire territory of Ukraine. And it is the return to Ukraine of all our people who were captured by Russia or forcibly deported from Ukraine to Russian territory., Ukraine's victory is the restoration of Ukraine's sovereignty within internationally recognized state borders without any restrictions on Ukraine's sovereign rights. Ukraine will independently choose alliances for itself and its future - obviously in the European Union, obviously in NATO., We have to realize that the path to the main thing - to our victory - is difficult. And now no one can say when we will complete it. But there must be national consensus on how to define our victory. When the goal is clear and fair, it doesn't matter how thorny the path to that goal is. Ukraine will walk this path to victory! And this is no longer a dream, it is a reality., Thanks to the successful defense against Russian colonialist and imperialist aggression, Ukraine is constantly increasing its moral capital, which is already the largest in the more than thousand-year history of Ukrainian statehood. Our leadership is already influencing the global balance of power. The future architecture of global, European and regional security is impossible without Ukraine's participation. Ukraine must be and will be a co-creator, participant and guarantor of such security. Ukraine is already a defender and will be a guarantor of the rules-based international order. Thanks to Ukraine, the world has seen that rules are not just the spirit and letter of the UN Charter, international treaties and conventions, it is also the energy of nations willing to defend the spirit and letter of international law. The existing international institutions are not able to ensure the effectiveness of international law. But during this war, we have created, together with our allies and partners, defense, sanctions, financial, and humanitarian coalitions that fill the deficit of resolve that objectively exists at the global level. For example, the Ramstein format is the most effective - the interaction of more than fifty countries to support our defense with weapons. And one of our defense coalitions, the Patriot coalition, has provided clear evidence to the world that any missile or air terror can be overcome. I am grateful to our partners., The organization that we created and that works effectively in the interests of our state and Ukrainians is the United24 public charity platform. This format has allowed us to unite hundreds of thousands of people from more than a hundred countries to directly help our country and people without the mediation of international bureaucracy. The purchase of drones, humanitarian demining, reconstruction of houses and purchase of medical equipment... The main thing that United24 gives is the opportunity for anyone from anywhere in the world to join - people, businesses, non-governmental and humanitarian organizations., With two maritime export initiatives, Ukraine has demonstrated its influence on global food security. Russia has been blackmailing the world with hunger - we know it - and it must be punished for that. Together with its partners, Ukraine launched the Black Sea Grain Initiative and the Grain from Ukraine humanitarian initiative, which have helped restore global food security, price predictability, and guarantees of social stability to dozens of countries, primarily in Africa and Asia. 45 countries have received food through the Black Sea Grain Initiative. Its geography ranges from Spain to China, from Indonesia to Morocco, from India to Kenya. Let us applaud our farmers, our citizens - all of them., Another humanitarian initiative of ours, Grain from Ukraine, has united more than 30 countries that have joined us in helping to protect countries such as Ethiopia, Somalia, Yemen, and others from famine. Ukraine, which went through the Holodomor genocide, is particularly sensitive to the fact that the Kremlin is trying to exacerbate the famine for other nations as well. If it wasn't for Russia's counteraction now, our maritime grain exports would be much higher. And it will be, because the world knows now that Ukraine is a globally important guarantor of food security for the whole world., Ukraine has proposed the Peace Formula, the only comprehensive and fair plan to overcome both the Russian aggression and all its consequences. The content of the points of the Peace Formula and the Formula itself are in line with the UN Charter and supported by the UN General Assembly. More than 25 international documents have declared support for the Peace Formula, including statements and declarations by the G7, the European Union, and the Council of Europe., We are uniting the world's majority for the full implementation of the Peace Formula and are preparing a Global Peace Summit that will allow all nations of the world to show their leadership in the implementation of certain points of the Formula., But why is there a deficit of resolve that prompts us, together with our allies and partners, to look for ways to fill it? There are two reasons for this., Unfortunately, the aggressor is still present in the organizations that are supposed to protect against aggression. In particular, this is the UN, where Russia is still allowed to exert influence in certain structures and where Russia abuses the permanent seat of the Security Council and the veto, which it seized, by the way, in violation of the UN Charter., The second reason is that some states and leaders of the world still, unfortunately, look back to Russia when making their own decisions. This can be called an absurd and shameful self-limitation of sovereignty, because Ukrainians have proven that Russia should not be feared. Russia loses when it meets bold and confident resistance. The free world has all the weaponry, sanctions, political, economic and, most importantly, value-based advantages that allow it to build a complete defense against any Russian encroachment and blackmail. And this is no longer a dream, it is a reality. Together with our partners, we have already started building such a system of advantages.,  , Dear attendees!, Please let us thank everyone in the world who supports our country, our struggle for freedom! The United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, Australia, all the G7 countries, all our partners, our friends, Poland, the Baltic states... most countries of the world... I thank you all! Thank you very much!, The victorious Ukraine will use the moral force gained to modernize the existing international institutions. We see the interest of various leaders and nations, in particular, in reforming the UN Security Council. This should be done on a fair basis., , We see that the coalitions and approaches we have developed to overcome Russian aggression and its consequences, having worked for Ukraine, are capable of ending other wars and removing dormant sources of destruction and death - the so-called ""frozen conflicts"" - from the face of the earth. Any frozen conflict is a war that will inevitably break out, and the only question is when and how many lives it will take. Therefore, peace must be fair. , This is the kind of peace envisioned by the Ukrainian Peace Formula. And that is why the Ukrainian Peace Formula has universal benefit. Ukraine will never agree to any option of a ""frozen conflict"", any! On the contrary, Ukraine will help all other nations of the world striving for a true, just peace with our Peace Formula., Ukraine has always relied and will continue to rely on alliances. Russia, on the other hand, views all its neighbors as slaves or enemies. Obviously, the world is and will be on our side. Obviously, Ukraine is strengthening and will continue to strengthen the partnerships and alliances in which it participates. And we have already historically strengthened the European Union and given the European unity such power that the European Union has never had. Every postulate for which the European Union was created is now working to the maximum throughout its existence. European values have never been as effective as they are now. The Ukrainian component is what the EU has been lacking. And it is no longer a dream, it is a reality. And we understand, and everyone there understands, that this is no longer a dream, it is a reality., Ukraine has gained the status of a candidate for accession to the European Union. This year we have to launch a dialogue on full membership. Ukraine is ready for this. And we all have to consider the European Union for Ukraine not only as a value-based and economic union, but also as security for Ukraine. The European Union is economic and institutional security for Ukraine. And Ukraine is a factor of unity for the European Union., The same will happen with NATO. And this is no longer a dream - it is already a reality. We are now a recipient of security assistance. But the victorious Ukraine will be a donor of security for our region, for the whole of Europe, for the whole world. And Ukraine is already a donor of moral strength. Anyone who cooperates effectively with Ukraine becomes a co-defender of the international order and universal values. In particular, NATO has had two fundamental weaknesses in recent years. First, there were doubts as to whether Article Five of the NATO Treaty would actually work. And we have all witnessed the world questioning whether the Alliance would defend the countries on NATO's eastern flank in the event of Russian aggression against them., Secondly, many in the world did not and do not perceive NATO as a defensive alliance, attributing to it - as a result of appropriate propaganda - some allegedly aggressive goals. Ukraine's accession to the Alliance will reliably eliminate these two weaknesses of NATO., First, no one any longer doubts that Ukraine is capable of defending itself and its allies. The strength of our security is also the strength of the security of our neighbors. Secondly, everyone in the world has seen that Russia's war against Ukraine is unprovoked and criminal - aggressive and genocidal. Ukraine's accession to NATO will be a powerful signal to the world that this is an Alliance that protects and will protect, and this is an Alliance that has the experience of winners and the moral superiority of winners - winners in a completely just defense., The entire eastern flank of NATO wants the United States, Germany, France, or Britain to deploy their soldiers in eastern Europe - near Russia's borders. After Ukraine's victory, the allies will want our combat brigades to be deployed on the land of our neighbors. Because Ukraine is a country of strength, everyone can see that., NATO will guarantee security for Ukraine, and our Defense and Security Forces will guarantee security and protection for other NATO members., For this to become a reality, there is only one thing that is needed: all our Allied partners should stop looking back to the Kremlin when making their important decisions. Even Russia's own internal forces have already stopped looking back to the Kremlin's weak master. Putin's madness has resulted in him driving himself into a dead end bunker because of his own weakness. Therefore, it is absurd to look back to such a failed leader of such a failed state., Ukraine's victory will free the world from such a problem as dangerous Russia. History proves that the defeat of a dictatorship is always an impetus for the spread of freedom., Ukraine's victory is a guarantee of security and restoration of territorial integrity for Moldova. Ukraine's victory is a historic chance for the territorial integrity of Georgia, and it is a peaceful chance. Ukraine's victory is a new strength for the entire South Caucasus. Ukraine's victory is freedom and peace for Belarus. Moreover, the liberation of Crimea from Russian occupation and a guaranteed safe Black Sea, together with the defeat of ruscism, will provide the necessary energy for the Baltic-Black Sea axis to work at the level of its real security, economic, and cultural capabilities., Ukraine's victory is a guarantee of security and protection from external manipulation, whether military or political, for the entire Central Asia. Ukraine's victory is a chance for the Middle East to de-escalate terror. Ukraine's victory is a guarantee that African countries from Libya to the Central African Republic will no longer be robbed by Russian thugs., And what will happen to Russia itself after our victory? I believe that Ukrainians should not care whether freedom will overcome the Kremlin's walls. Ukrainians only care about ensuring that Russian revanchism never again crosses the borders of our free state and threatens our free people. We will ensure this!, As a full member of NATO, Ukraine will guarantee that peace and freedom will prevail everywhere in our region. And it would be right for Russia to ask for Ukraine's membership in NATO now, because NATO members defend and do not destroy... NATO states protect peoples, not attack their neighbors to destroy their future. Russia, as an aggressor, knows this better than anyone. Russia, which is entering an era of rebellions and systemic weakness, is more than anyone else interested in security on its internationally recognized borders. This means that Russia is also interested in Ukraine as a member of NATO. This may not be visible to someone only from Moscow or Valday bunkers. The whole world sees it!, The modern Russian statehood poses an existential threat to Ukraine and does not respect any treaties whose force is not backed by the power of available weapons to defend Ukraine. Therefore, regardless of how the global agenda on Russia evolves, Ukraine will have the necessary weapons to defend itself and its allies against any Russian encroachment on our sovereignty and the safety of our people., Ukraine will have a sufficient number and quality of the army and the Defense and Security Forces in general to protect its sovereignty, its territory, its people, and its allies., Glory to Ukraine!, Ukraine will have a sufficiently powerful defense industry to meet the needs of our army, our navy, our sky shield, and our security in cyberspace. This is very important., At the bottom of the Black Sea, there is already very strong evidence of Ukraine's capability as a missile-producing state. The Neptunes, which were put into service in 2020, hit their targets accurately. Now, during such a war and against all odds, we have established virtually from scratch the production of scarce artillery shells, actual artillery. We have resumed production of 122-mm and 125-mm shells and other calibers. We are starting to replace 152-mm production with 155-mm Western standard. The Ukrainian artillery has been created already now, during this full-scale Russian aggression. Let's applaud all the people who have done this. Let's thank them that this is not a dream - it is a reality again., High-quality Ukrainian artillery, our own production of shells. We understand that the volume of production is not yet sufficient. We still need global support. But it will be sufficient, we will be able to do it!, Ukraine has learned to build naval drones. And we are successfully using them! In general, the production of various types of drones is an industry that should become the most powerful in Europe in Ukraine. Anyone in the world who wants to be at the forefront of this modern industry should know that Ukraine has the most favorable conditions for this. A clear, concrete benchmark for government policy., We strive to produce and localize in Ukraine the necessary weapons systems - air defense systems, tanks, artillery, armored vehicles - supplied by our partners. Our warriors will always have weapons!, And I propose the following principle for the Ukrainian Doctrine, its global security component: not to guess what to expect from Russia, but to be prepared for any evil, so that any evil in Russia is always sure that it will lose against Ukraine., Never again is the key principle of the Ukrainian Doctrine in relation to Russia. Never again., This also applies to the old spiritual dependence that was used by the aggressor to put pressure on our country. Ukraine's spiritual independence will be ensured - one hundred percent. And the strongest internal guarantor of the effectiveness of this principle – ""never again"" – is our heroes. Everyone who fights for Ukraine. And everyone who gave and gives life for Ukraine.,  , Ladies and Gentlemen!, Please observe a moment of silence in memory of all our heroes of different times who fought for Ukraine's freedom and independence. Please do so., Thank you., Our dear defenders! , Dear relatives of our warriors!, The Ukrainian state needs new principles of gratitude to you, gratitude to all those who fought in the war for Ukraine's freedom and independence. The invaluable experience of Ukrainian warriors should be effectively used in the process of ensuring real security for the world., This sounds generic, but it can be deciphered into quite specific elements of the policy of heroes that I propose for the Ukrainian Doctrine., First. Our warriors who wish to continue serving the Ukrainian state and people after the war can be sure that the state will have such a request., Second. Ukraine is already the only country in the world with a successful experience of effective defense against full-scale aggression. The victorious Ukraine will have even more of this important, valuable experience. And we are developing a platform for exporting Ukrainian defense knowledge and practices - real experience of our heroes. The participation of Ukrainians in peacekeeping missions, particularly under the auspices of the United Nations, international training missions... All of these are enormous opportunities for Ukraine and for our heroes., Third. Ukraine needs a fundamentally new system of military education. Ukrainian warriors and all those who train Ukrainian warriors should know that real practice will be the basis of the new Ukrainian military education. The state will integrate the training programs that have now proven their effectiveness, as well as the real combat experience of our soldiers and sailors, sergeants, foremen, officers, and our generals, into the military education system., Fourth. The world's leaders are already showing interest in training their future warriors in Ukraine. And this will definitely become one of the opportunities that will make Ukraine's security influence truly global and worldwide., Fifth. Ukraine needs to fully integrate veterans into social and economic life. The heroes of our victory should be able to prove themselves as heroes of our transformation. Servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the National Guard, our border guards, our intelligence officers, heroes of the special services, the police - all of them! In particular, the transformation of Ukrainian military education will include the possibility for our warriors to obtain a related civilian specialty., Sixth. The main principle of social work with veterans in the victorious Ukraine is ""equal with equal"". The state must create a system of support for the warriors and the families of our warriors that will guarantee them that their every emotion and need will be understood by the person helping them, because this person has gone through the war, has gone through losses, has gone through everything that needs to be understood to be effective in integrating veterans into social and economic life. Warriors are the most effective helpers for other warriors, and the relatives of our warriors are the most effective helpers for other relatives of warriors., Seventh. Ukraine's policy of heroes requires a real national standard of a barrier-free environment. These are new requirements for urban planning, infrastructure, public space, transportation, social and educational systems, and business environment. Requirements that will allow every person with war trauma to enjoy the same space and opportunities as others., Eighth. The barrier-free environment also has a psychological component, so the need for mental rehabilitation is the same as the need for physical rehabilitation. Ukraine needs to create the strongest rehabilitation industry in Europe. This applies to both the construction of rehabilitation centers and the training of relevant personnel. The state will facilitate the creation of the necessary number of jobs not only to provide rehabilitation for our people, but also to enable us to become a global exporter of practices of recovery and integration into post-war life for absolutely everyone who has experienced and suffered from war., All the world's best practices, all the most effective policies, all the solutions, no matter how difficult or unusual they may seem to us, must be applied in Ukraine so that Ukrainians, all our citizens do not have to endure the pain, stress, and trauma of war. In particular, we must finally fairly legalize cannabis-based medicines for all those who need them, with appropriate scientific research and controlled Ukrainian production., Ninth. Veterans in the civil service in Ukraine, in councils of various levels, and in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine are an honor for the state. Hiring veterans is an honor for any business. Helping veterans start their own business is an honor for the state, for every community, for every business association, and for anyone who knows what it means to be at war. And this should not be a dream, it should be a reality in Ukraine!, This is a large-scale national task. And I will say frankly: to accomplish this task faster and better, the state will need help., I ask our volunteers to help the state with this. Please start studying the experience of the world in terms of economic and social integration, rehabilitation of veterans, and relevant state and municipal changes in countries around the world. So that Ukraine, our victorious state, can channel the best in our warriors into the best for Ukraine.,  , Ladies and Gentlemen!, I would like you to thank all Ukrainian volunteers, each and every one of them, for this extraordinary strength, for their reliability, for their historic contribution to the defense of Ukrainian freedom, to the defense of our lives, to the defense of our independence. We are grateful to you!, And the tenth point of the policy of heroes, which I propose to discuss when creating the Ukrainian Doctrine, is the culture of heroes., Memorializing the war and the experience of our victory. Creating a Pantheon of Heroes and a National Military Cemetery. Establishment of a National Museum of the Russian-Ukrainian War and a system of local museums that will honor the memory of the war and preserve the experience of victory for future generations of the Ukrainian people., Creative reflection on the experience of war, exporting the experience of our victory by means of culture., Creating an official history of the war, defining a national canon of interpretation of the war with Russia - participants in the war, key events of the war, stages of the war, Russian war crimes and achievements of our Ukrainian resistance., A new cultural policy regarding our heroes of different times who fought for Ukraine's freedom and independence, and the reburial in Ukraine of all our heroes who are buried abroad. This is very important., The victorious Ukraine will promote all forms of developing a culture of heroes in Ukraine., And I have focused so much on the policy of heroes for the victorious Ukraine because any ineffectiveness of this policy will deprive everything else that will be happening in our country of moral meaning. We must make our policy of heroes as effective as possible!, The policy of justice in Ukraine is directly related to this., Justice is the number one requirement of everyone in our country for domestic life, and of our country for the world., I'll start with internal justice., Recently, the Dniprovskyi District Court of Kyiv delivered a verdict in the case of a brutal assault on Kateryna Handziuk. On July 31, 2018, the attackers doused Kateryna with concentrated sulfuric acid. She died of severe burns in hospital on November 4, 2018. May she rest in peace!, In 2019 and 2020, the perpetrators of this crime were convicted. Now there is a verdict for the hirer and co-organizer of the assault. The court found them guilty and sentenced them to 10 years in prison., We have to be honest: if it had not been for the persistent pressure and constant attention of civil society and Kateryna's friends, if it had not been for various rallies, protests and calls to punish those who ordered the crime, justice would have been destroyed at the very beginning. The criminals counted on this. They were sure, as always, of impunity., I am grateful to everyone who fought for justice in this case, to everyone who worked properly to ensure legitimate verdicts. But this should have happened without public pressure!, We have all recently seen the case of the former head of the Supreme Court. Greed that discredits the judicial institution. A man who sows despair, humiliation, and anger in Ukraine with his behavior. And he sows it from the highest judicial authority., There are other examples of injustice that are outrageous and simply demotivating, including for our warriors. People sacrifice the most valuable - their lives and health - for the sake of the state. And state institutions, including the judiciary and law enforcement, must undergo a transformation that will protect our society from injustice., The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine has proposed to increase the accountability of judges and other judicial officials for crimes in the field of justice and corruption. We also propose to tighten the rules for checking the integrity of judges, including the use of lie detectors and polygraphs. We must also attach a new, significant importance to jury trials as one of the elements of democracy in the state. I know that relevant legislative initiatives are already being prepared. I am asking you, dear Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, dear deputies, to support this request for justice., Now, when we will define the parameters of our Ukrainian Doctrine and the transformation of our state, we must consider the policy of justice on a par with the policy of the Ukrainian victory, the policy of Ukraine's security, and the policy of our heroes. Justice is a social order in which a person wants to live in a country because he or she feels that his or her life, health, work, dignity, pursuit of happiness, family, and future are reliably protected by law and fair justice within a reasonable time frame that actually works., The sense of justice in Ukraine should be the strongest in Europe! And it will be so! We must achieve this. This is an ambitious goal, but Ukraine knows how to make the ambitious ordinary. We have to find all the necessary systemic solutions to satisfy the Ukrainian thirst for justice., Now regarding another justice - in relation to the Russian-Ukrainian war., , The issue of justice regarding war and genocidal policies is never easy. But in this case, with Russia's aggression against our freedom, the more difficulties and hesitations the world has regarding justice for Ukraine and Ukrainians, the greater, unfortunately, revanchist sentiments in different parts of the world may become. The inevitability of punishment is one of the main tools for deterring crime. Just as it can work effectively within national jurisdictions, it will work in global relations., All Russian murderers, terrorists, and torturers must be held accountable for their crimes against Ukrainians., The political and military leadership of Russia must not avoid justice on the grounds that they allegedly have immunity as leaders of the state. They are not leaders of the state, they are bandits who have seized control of Russia's state institutions, and they have become absolutely arrogant with this impunity and have begun to terrorize the world., Every political bandit puts himself outside the scope of any usual international relations. And every asset that belongs to a terrorist state or to any individuals from the circle of the President of the Russian Federation who are associated with the current system of rule in Russia must be used to compensate those for whom this war and the aggressiveness of this rule have resulted in burned cities and villages, and the loss of loved ones., I am grateful to everyone in the world who perceives the Russian political and military leadership in this way - as individuals who must end their careers in the dock in The Hague. And Russian assets - as those that must be frozen, confiscated and used to compensate for the damage caused by Russian aggression., Ukraine will do its utmost to ensure that the Special Tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against our country is established and starts working in reality - with criminals in the dock., I would like to thank the International Criminal Court for being as decisive as it needs to be to protect international law and humanity. The time will come when international arrest warrants for Russian rulers and their accomplices will not be sensational, but simply a common working tool of global justice. Because if this is not the case, other potential aggressors and other terrorist states will feel the same impunity as Russia. And our Ukrainian mission is, in particular, to create this historical precedent of aggressor's accountability for everything committed in war., Part of justice is the world's true attitude to our war for freedom and independence, as well as to other pages of our history that were distorted by one form of totalitarian evil or another. It is the duty of the Ukrainian state to honor the memory of all victims of the Holodomor, the genocide of the Ukrainian people, as well as all victims of the deportation of the Crimean Tatar people, and all victims of the Holocaust.,  , Dear attendees!, Please, let us now thank all Ukrainian and international journalists, all our Ukrainian and foreign historians who are spreading the truth about this aggression, about Russia's war against Ukraine, about our life and about justice for our people., Thank you!,  , Dear Ukrainians!, The fifth guideline for the Ukrainian Doctrine, which I would like to propose for discussion today, is transformation in ten years., In this time, we have to overcome a path that other nations have been overcoming for decades, and this is true. The victorious Ukraine will get special attention and trust from the world, and every manifestation of such attention and trust should be directed to the development of Ukraine and all aspects of life in our country., First. The specific goal for Ukraine's GDP is a trillion dollars. Yes, this is a very high bar, and it seems unrealistic, but Ukraine's potential is capable of achieving it., Second. The victorious Ukraine will abandon the idea that the labor of Ukrainians is supposed to be cheap, because the cheap labor of our people was supposed to be a competitive advantage of Ukraine., Our goal is to reach a level of wages that could be determined by the formula ""neighbors in the European Union plus 30%"". This is a goal, a fair goal, for this war. The victorious Ukraine will rely primarily on skilled labor. And therefore, on education., The Government of Ukraine and the team of Deputy Prime Minister for Innovation Fedorov are currently developing a program to significantly modernize Ukrainian education and stimulate the development of science in Ukraine. It is a very detailed program that deserves attention, and it contains many solutions that deserve discussion and, if approved by our government and the nation, implementation., The educational section of the Ukrainian Doctrine should be elaborated as much as possible - every stage of the educational process, all the elements that are important for education in Ukraine., A nation that wants to be a leader makes education a leader. And it makes education fair., We must also honestly say that in today's world, the language of global cooperation is English. And it is true. It is the language of global business, global science and global communication. The Ukraine of the future, the victorious Ukraine, requires the spread of English so that Ukrainian interests can spread around the world and our people can gain new global opportunities for themselves and for Ukraine. By the way, today I have submitted a relevant legislative initiative on the English language in Ukraine to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine., Third. We are facing an overwhelming challenge to bring home as many of our people who have left the country as possible. So, the victorious Ukraine needs as many new jobs as possible that will be attractive to our people, that will allow them to live in Ukraine more decently than in other countries., The transformation of every sector of the economy, every social practice, and all spheres of public administration must answer the question of how many new jobs a particular solution or initiative will create in Ukraine., Fourth. Ukraine needs a new policy of support for parenthood and childhood. The second and third child in a family is happiness, not a limitation of opportunities, and it is this happiness that state policy should work for. Ukraine will support parenthood at all stages. Ukraine will respect every family and will do everything to ensure that family upbringing is the defining feature in Ukraine. Our country is not for boarding schools., Fifth. Ukrainian Diia has become a global example of social progress. We did it when no one believed that such a project to develop the capabilities of citizens and the entire country could succeed. But we did it. The app has over 19 million users. My congratulations to you. And the absolute usefulness of Diia., Now, the Ukrainian Diia is becoming an export product of our country - we are teaching other nations to digitize based on our digitized services, based on our Diia., And we will create another system, the Ukrainian Mriia. A special app that will support everything related to parents and children. Services that parents need, that children need. Development and education. Security and contact with the state., Mriia will help provide equal access to knowledge from any corner of the world, and the use of artificial intelligence will help each child build their own unique educational trajectory for success., Ukraine's digital transformation team will present this Mriia in the autumn., Sixth. Protecting business is as important as protecting employees and labor., To make the welfare and economic development indicators, which are a dream now, a reality, the victorious Ukraine must be a country of business and a country of labor., Just as millions of our people are now fighting and working in unity for our victory, we must work in unity after our victory to ensure that Ukraine is among the world's economic leaders., Economic leadership brings security. Everyone who creates new jobs in Ukraine creates the basis for Ukraine's economic leadership., The victorious Ukraine will protect the right of every person to work as long and as hard as he or she wishes. We need to modernize labor legislation., Seventh. The victorious Ukraine needs a new rational tax agreement between the state and society and real legalization of property., I am a supporter of tax cuts. But now, in this time of war and Ukraine's obvious dependence on cooperation with financial donors, we cannot afford to cut taxes. But when the victorious Ukraine becomes a donor to the world itself, our level of opportunities will be higher., Reduced taxes should mean increased tax compliance., Digitalization offers tremendous opportunities to simplify relations in the field of taxes, customs and all other areas where there is a meeting or any contact between a citizen and an official, between a businessman and an official. Our goal is to have a tax office without tax officers and customs without customs officers. Automatic digital procedures., Eighth.Transformation is bigger than rebuilding. , Of course, the victorious Ukraine will become Europe's largest construction site., We need to rebuild hundreds of towns and villages, thousands of infrastructure facilities, hundreds of thousands of houses. This will give a boost to the economy., But the main thing is something else. We have to forget about our past as a raw material exporter. The victorious Ukraine is a country of high value added goods. It is a country where regulations allow the development of any business that is an innovator in its field and where intellectual property is protected. The victorious Ukraine is a country that exports security, services, experience, culture, and, in general, the results of intellectual activity, technological products more than any raw materials., Ninth. The victorious Ukraine is a country where no one can be called an oligarch, because all economic entities are equal before the law. Ukraine is interested in new technology businesses that will matter more in the global market than any old raw materials business. And objectively, we have a natural advantage, and that is our natural resource reserves. These include metals and minerals that are particularly valuable for modern industries, such as lithium and graphite. However, the metallurgy in the victorious Ukraine must be green to meet the modern environmental standards of the European Union and not focused on the export of raw materials., We will develop cooperation and economic relations with all global players. In particular, with India, Africa, Latin America, the Arab world, with China, with everyone., Tenth. Our energy potential allows Ukraine to become one of the guarantors of Europe's energy security. The entire continent needs our generation, including nuclear power., But I would like us to support our power engineers and thank them for this winter. Thank you very much! Our country's massive priority is green generation and large-scale energy accumulation capacities. We have to make Ukraine's green energy potential a potential for real massive earnings for our people., , Eleventh. The victorious Ukraine is a country that has implemented pension reform - and we really want and need it - and guaranteed decent future support for all those who work today., The existing solidarity pension system alone is not enough, and you know it, and the vast majority of our Ukrainian pensioners feel it. And I am asking you, dear MPs, to realize all this. To realize the dream of Ukrainians. The victorious Ukraine will do everything to ensure that our elderly people, who are already retired, have a higher standard of living. The victorious Ukraine will do everything to ensure that those who work today have a truly secure retirement., Twelfth. Ukrainian culture is an export industry. And it is an industry that generates constant and significant attention of the world to the victorious Ukraine. The victorious Ukraine needs this kind of view of the cultural sector., Currently, the cultural sector needs at least one percent of GDP per year as a basic level for survival. But it is clear that the industry should and must be more ambitious., Ukrainian courage has indeed awakened a tremendous interest of people from different countries in us, in Ukrainians, in our cities and villages of Ukraine. Every such interest is an opportunity., Ukraine needs a new policy for protecting public space in cities and communities that can be used as cultural space or preserves a particular historical value., Ukraine needs a new museum and memorial policy. Unfortunately, entire generations of Ukrainian greatness remain without museum expression. At the same time, the existing museums do not meet the spirit and standards of modern museums., Ukraine needs a new policy of books and book publishing, writing and reading, translating foreign books for Ukraine, and spreading the Ukrainian language and Ukrainian books in the world. Support for bookstores. Audiobooks. Digital subscription services. Rethinking our Ukrainian libraries. Basically, we must ensure a clear annual increase in the number of books by Ukrainians, books for Ukrainians, and books by Ukrainians for the whole world., Ukraine needs a new cinematography policy and support for filmmaking. Ukrainians should make films, and the world should make films about Ukraine and in Ukraine. We all know what solutions are needed for this., Thirteenth. Ukraine needs a new policy of territories. Each region liberated from Russian occupation needs its own very detailed and at the same time holistic, visionary transformation policy., The new free Ukrainian Crimea - what is it like? Can it become a new California in Europe, a place that attracts talent? With a cluster of modern technology companies, IT, creative industries, and a truly modern hospitality industry. A Crimea that works all year round, not just three months., The new free Donbas - what is it like? Will it be industrial?, The new free Ukrainian Pryazovia. What exactly will attract people to move to this part of our beautiful country?, Kherson and Kramatorsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kupyansk, Melitopol and Mariupol... What will the new life look like in these cities of Ukraine, victorious cities?, And these are very important questions, and we must have an answer to them and answer them together. Each of our regions, each of our cities, each of our communities needs its own vision., Obviously, Odesa is not only a globally important port. Kharkiv is obviously not only an outpost of freedom on the eastern border of Europe. It is obvious. But Odesa and Kharkiv deserve to be among the European leaders, and the victorious Ukraine needs a new policy for the sake of such cities, for the sake of all our cities, for the sake of Kharkiv. A new policy for the sake of Odesa., Obviously, Kharkiv will be an outpost of freedom and strength on the eastern border of Europe. But what will make Kharkiv one of the leading European cities?, Obviously, Dnipro, Lviv, Uzhhorod, Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities during this war have not only faced new problems, but also received new opportunities. How can the state help cities realize these opportunities? This is very important., I ask everyone to be very specific in the discussion about the transformation of Ukraine., Fourteenth. Internal security. Russian aggression has shown us what security standards are needed for life. Accessibility of shelters - maximum. Schools - with a shelter. Hospitals - with a shelter. Houses - with a shelter. Ukrainians will trust specific things that provide specific security., In Ukraine, children should be taught security from childhood. This is the kind of neighbor we have. Every adult Ukrainian should know basic first aid principles. , Physical culture and sports education are not entertainment today, they are one of the foundations of security. Because this is human health, this is the health of the nation, this is the strength of Ukrainians., The main thing is to provide opportunities. Active parks for active people. More opportunities for children. Different opportunities. Implementation of very specific programs., We have to settle the issue of weapons that are and will be in the hands of our people. This is a fact. This is a controversial issue for our society, like any other democratic society. But the answer should be reflected in the Ukrainian Doctrine. In very specific things., Mine clearance. This is one of the biggest challenges for Ukraine. But we know what needs to be done. The world has the technologies. Ukrainian needs – our partners are aware of all this. And although it is often said that demining the entire territory of Ukraine, which is unfortunately contaminated with Russian mines, will take decades, we know that it is possible to do it faster – in years., Everyday security. Of course, society has completely different views on the use of surveillance cameras on the streets and roads, and on the automatic analytical capabilities of surveillance systems. But it is obvious that they will help reduce the level of violations and crime, traffic-related deaths and incidents on the streets. This is necessary., Combating domestic violence. This is an important area in which, unfortunately, an increase in cases of domestic violence is being recorded, and especially at this time., Minister of Internal Affairs Klymenko and his team are working in detail on each of these areas of internal security and, I am sure, are ready to present their proposals to the public for national discussion., And finally, the fifteenth point. Neighborhood policy. Why is this point the last among the guidelines I want to propose today? Because a strong neighborhood is always the result of very different, very profound things. In fact, a successful neighborhood can summarize any of our other successes in our country, in our region, and in global relations., Economy and culture. Defense and security. Transport and communication. Education and attitude to history. Interaction between states and interaction between us, between people... All this determines the quality of neighborhood. It determines whether there is understanding between neighbors., Poland, Romania, Moldova, Slovakia, Hungary. Our neighbors in the Black Sea region – Bulgaria, Türkiye, Georgia. Relations with each of them require a separate and detailed presentation of what has been achieved as well as opportunities, existing challenges and prospects. But what do they all have in common for us?, They, like us, want to live in peace on their land. Just as they are now helping us to defend freedom, Ukraine will always help them to defend their lives., Peace will always reign in our region, in our Europe. Peace that will be the sum of security and freedom that we have to establish. For the new Ukraine! The victorious Ukraine. The winner. This is a fact., Glory to Ukraine!"
27 June 2023  - 23:11 ,Every manifestation of terror proves to the whole world that Russia deserves only defeat and a tribunal - address by the President of Ukraine,", Fellow Ukrainians!, Exactly on the anniversary of the Russian terrorists' attack on Kremenchuk, on the shopping mall, when 22 people were killed, Russian savages again fired missiles at the Kremenchuk district., Today, Russian terrorists also brutally shelled Kramatorsk. S-300 missiles. Three people were killed, including a child. My condolences to the families and friends. As of this hour, more than 40 people are wounded. Assistance is being provided to all. The rubble is being cleared., Each such manifestation of terror proves over and over again to us and to the whole world that Russia deserves only one thing as a result of everything it has done - defeat and a tribunal, fair and legal trials against all Russian murderers and terrorists., And I thank again and again everyone in the world who supports Ukraine and helps protect our people!, Today we have a new defense package from the United States for our warriors.

27 June 2023  - 00:30 ,"Today, our warriors have advanced in all directions, and this is a happy day - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, Today - the front. Donetsk region, Zaporizhzhia. Our warriors, our frontline positions, areas of active operations at the front. Today, our warriors have advanced in all directions, and this is a happy day. I wished the guys more days like this., I paid a visit to the Khortytsia units that distinguished themselves heroically in the Battle of Bakhmut. Well done, warriors! Then our marines - very powerful, very accurate. Thank you for doing your best to save the lives of our warriors. Then Tavria, the south, the front. It was a busy day, a lot of emotions... I was honored to award our warriors, to thank them personally, to shake their hands. Thank you for all your words of support, guys! Thank you for your hugs, very warm ones, to everyone today. And thank you for your chevrons - it is extremely honorable for me, and I will tell about each chevron separately. All our warriors - from soldiers to sailors to generals - are doing a great job!, I presented two Gold Stars of the Hero of Ukraine – to Captain Oleh Olyva, commander of the airmobile company of the 81st separate airborne assault brigade, and Major Serhiy Dudin, deputy commander of the marine battalion of the 35th separate brigade. Indeed, they are great people, thank you!, Meetings with generals... Zubanych, Tarnavskyi, Sodol, Syrskyi. Several operational decisions were made.

25 June 2023  - 23:12 ,"The longer the Russian aggression lasts, the more degradation it causes in Russia itself – address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, I have just completed a series of international conversations – with President of the United States Biden, with Prime Minister of Canada Trudeau, and with President of Poland Andrzej Duda. Positive conversations that are very necessary right now for all of us., First. Of course, we discussed the hostilities on the frontline, our active actions. I thanked our partners for the support provided – it is very significant and really helps our soldiers move forward. Now the Russian occupiers are suffering losses, which we need. Each of their losses is a long-term strengthening of freedom., We also discussed further strengthening of Ukrainian troops, and I thank our partners for understanding our needs – long-range needs. I am especially grateful to President Biden and the United States for the reliability of Patriots. We discussed the strengthening of our artillery, MLRS and other things., Second. The situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Unfortunately, the world's attention to the existing Russian threat at the Zaporizhzhia NPP is still insufficient. Just as the reaction to the Russian blowing up of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant and the deliberate attempt by Russian terrorists to hit the dam of another reservoir in Kryvyi Rih was insufficient., I shared with our partners the information we have, the information from our intelligence, about the Russian scenario of mining the Zaporizhzhia NPP, which has obviously been approved for terrorists. We must take very specific steps – all together in the world – to prevent any radiation accidents., Third. The longer Russian aggression lasts, the more degradation it causes in Russia itself. One of the manifestations of this degradation is that Russian aggression is gradually returning to its home harbor. In our conversations with the leaders, we have exchanged our assessments of what is happening in Russia. We see the situation in the same way and know how to respond. , And one more thing. Very important meetings took place today in Copenhagen. The format of political advisors. The Office's team – Andriy Yermak, Andriy Sybiha, and Ihor Zhovkva – met with political advisors to the leaders of Türkiye, India, Japan, South Africa, and the European Union institutions. We are bringing the implementation of the Peace Formula closer, and for this purpose we involve the widest possible range of partners. Relations with the European Union remain a top priority, and every week we are laying the basis for full membership., With just 15 days to go until the NATO Summit in Vilnius, we are doing everything to ensure that the summit has real content. Strong content. Positive decisions for Ukraine in Vilnius are the only possible positive decisions for our common security in Europe and in the Alliance as a whole., Thank you to everyone who supports Ukraine! Thank you to Mr. President Biden, the Congress, both parties and all Americans for the historic strengthening of freedom in the world! Thank you to Mr. Prime Minister Trudeau and all Canadians for your unwavering support! Thank you to Mr. President Duda and everyone in Poland who stands with Ukraine in the defense of Europe!, Glory to our warriors! Glory to every brigade that is now moving forward at the front... Tavria direction – you are doing a great job! Thank you!, Glory to Ukraine!"
25 June 2023  - 11:17 ,"It is right for our people, our children to know to whom we owe our lives and freedom of Ukraine - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s address",", Fellow Ukrainians!, I would like to dedicate this address primarily to our warriors. To all those who are fighting in the most difficult battles, to all those who are leading this war to Ukraine's victory., Of course, I'll focus on the Tavria units - the ones that did the biggest amount of work at the front this week., Marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades. Thank you, guys! The 110th separate mechanized brigade named after Brigadier General Marko Bezruchko. Thank you, warriors! Artillerymen of the 55th Zaporizhzhia Sich brigade. I am proud of you, and it is an honor for me every time to celebrate you, our heroes! Paratroopers of the 79th separate brigade - again and again I thank you guys for your extraordinary strength! The 128th separate mountain assault brigade of Zakarpattia... Thank you, warriors! Thank you for each of your results for Ukraine!, Today I would like to personally recognize Senior Lieutenant Ivan Hrysiuk, Junior Sergeant Mykola Komisar and Soldier Volodymyr Kononuchenko. Thank you for your strength and precision!, Our border guards. The Kramatorsk, Lviv and Donetsk border guard detachments and the troops of the Dozor mobile border guard detachment. I thank all of you! And I would like to especially mention Senior Sergeant Oleksandr Koprovsky from the air reconnaissance group, Senior Soldier Viktor Polishchuk, and Soldier Roman Borys. Thank you, guys!, Our National Guard. The 4th operational brigade of the National Guard. It is fighting in Donetsk region. Thank you, warriors! In particular, I would like to mention the aerial reconnaissance men - Senior Soldier Oleksandr Pohorenyi and Soldier Maksym Bobruyenko. Your skills, guys, are very helpful!, And I would like all our people, each and every one in Ukraine, to thank our warriors in this way - personally. To your family and friends who are at the front. To your acquaintances. To those you have heard about. Those you follow on social media. Those whose families you know. Please thank, support and tell your friends, your children and people around the world about our warriors. Our warriors deserve it. They are real heroes., And one more thing., From time to time my son comes to my office. From time to time, but nevertheless. And he is most interested here in these chevrons. Military personnel, volunteers, relatives of our soldiers handed them to me. At the front and in Kyiv, in hospitals, during the award ceremonies for heroes in the Mariyinsky Palace. The number of chevrons on the chevron board is growing, but very slowly, as every time Kyrylo takes them away. And I am happy that he is interested in this. Our heroes, our defense, Ukrainian chevrons., A long time ago I wanted to make a special series of posts in my social networks about these chevrons. About where they came from. Who gave them to me. What these units are. And today, we will start issuing such posts., Maybe someone else wants to talk about the chevrons you have. I think that it is right. It is right for our people, our children to know to whom we owe our lives and Ukraine’s freedom. Thank you, warriors! Thank you to everyone who fights and works for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
24 June 2023  - 20:10 ,"Ukraine will definitely be able to protect Europe from any Russian forces, and it doesn't matter who commands them – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Dear Ukrainians, all the people of the world, good health to you!, Today is a day when there definitely should be no silence. And we definitely need leadership., Today the world saw that the bosses of Russia do not control anything. Nothing at all. Complete chaos. Complete absence of any predictability. And it is happening on Russian territory, which is fully loaded with weapons., We all remember how the head of Russia threatened the world in 2021. He had some ultimatums, he was trying to show a kind of strength..., The year 2022 showed that he confused – confused his illusions and the lies he was fed with strength. They in the Kremlin are capable of resorting to any terror, capable of resorting to any stupidity, but they cannot provide even one percent of the necessary control. And they are the real problem., In one day, they lost several of their million-plus cities and showed all Russian bandits, mercenaries, oligarchs and anyone else how easy it is to capture Russian cities and, probably, arsenals with weapons., Now, it is very important that no one in the world remains silent because of being afraid of this Russian chaos. All the actions of the leaders now can be historic. Every word of journalists is worth its weight in gold. It is necessary to clearly name the source of the problem. And if someone in the world tries to ignore the situation, if someone in the world is under the illusion that the Kremlin is capable of regaining control... this only postpones the problem until the next breakthrough of chaos – even more dangerous., We all know the solution., First, the world should not be afraid. We know that only our unity protects us., Ukraine will definitely be able to protect Europe from any Russian forces, and it doesn't matter who commands them. We will protect. The security of Europe's eastern flank depends only on our defense. And that is why every manifestation of support for our defense is support for your defense, everyone in the free world., Ukrainian soldiers, Ukrainian guns, Ukrainian tanks, Ukrainian missiles are all that protect Europe from such marches as we see today on Russian territory. And when we ask to give us the F-16 fighters or the ATACMS, we're enhancing our common defense. Real defense. This is what is needed. Now is the time to provide all the weapons necessary for defense., Second, everything must be real. It's time for everyone in the world to frankly say that all of Russia's criminal actions against Ukraine were and are unprovoked. And we all have to focus exclusively on our common security priorities. NATO is not just a word or a set of formal promises. These are reliable guarantees for everyone that peace won't be destroyed. Without Ukraine, such guarantees are worthless. Already in July at the summit in Vilnius, it is a historic chance for real decisions without looking back at Russia. Any nation that borders Russia really supports this., And the third... I will say it in Russian. The man from the Kremlin is obviously very afraid and probably hiding somewhere, not showing himself. I am sure that he is no longer in Moscow. He calls somewhere, and asks something... He knows what he is afraid of because he himself created this threat. All evil, all losses, all hatred – he himself who spreads it. And the longer he can run between his bunkers, the more you all will lose... all who are connected with Russia., What will we, Ukrainians, do?, We will defend our country. We will defend our freedom. We will not be silent and we will not be inactive. We know how to win – and it will happen. Our victory in this war will definitely be., And what will you do?, The longer your troops stay on Ukrainian land, the more devastation they will bring to Russia. The longer this person is in the Kremlin, the more disasters there will be., And now I'm switching to my native language., Thanks to our soldiers! Thanks to everyone who is now beating the occupiers! Thanks to the Air Force for protecting our skies!, Glory to Ukraine!, We will defeat everyone!"
23 June 2023  - 19:39 ,May Ukraine's victory and state institutions' successful transformation be best tribute to memory of all our heroes – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, The summary of this busy day., The meeting based on the results of the London Ukraine Recovery Conference is a powerful event, good gains for our country. The support from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union is crucial. Long-term support programs for the future, for years to come. About five hundred global companies, strong companies, are interested in investing in Ukraine. Clear support for Ukraine's EU membership: we are already perceived as an EU member politically. Separately, we are working on the mechanism for the confiscation of the assets of the terrorist state and its associated persons. I thank everyone who prepared the conference and participated in its work, it is really important., A very meaningful meeting of the National Security and Defense Council today. I have already reported on it separately. I just held a Supreme Commander-in-Chief's Staff meeting. Justice is also a very important point of our discussion at the Staff meeting. Issues concerning military commission chiefs, in particular the scandal with... a figure in Odesa. This person should definitely not be in the recruitment system of the Armed Forces, it is very unpleasant, frankly immoral, and wrong that this person remained in his position despite everything. I've instructed Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny to remove this person from his post. And First Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Pavliuk has been instructed to organize an inspection of this entire system of military commissions. It is a pity that the Staff meeting's attention and time now have to be spent on such issues., Of course, the situation on the front line was discussed in great detail – all the main directions, ammunition supply, artillery... Everything that requires the Staff's attention today. Commanders – Generals Zaluzhny, Syrsky, Tarnavsky, Moskalyov, Vice-Admiral Neizhpapa, General Malyuk, and government officials reported to the meeting. All., I had the honor to congratulate the officers of our military educational institutions on their graduation... Six higher education institutions at once. Kharkiv National University of the Air Force, Military Institute of Tank Troops of Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute, Military Institute of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Kruty Heroes Military Institute of Telecommunications and Informatization, Ukrainian Military Medical Academy and the Department of Military Training of the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine. I thank each and every one who chooses to be a Ukrainian officer, and I wish for two absolutely fundamental things: to destroy the occupiers as much as possible and win as soon as possible., And two more things., Today, the Civil Service Day is celebrated in our country. The day of those people without whose integrity there is no effective state. Of course, we still have a lot to do so that the civil service in Ukraine gets closer to the models we are aiming for in our policy. But now I want to thank all our people who, under the existing conditions and with the available resources in the state, are doing everything that depends on them to make the state effective. Thank you! To each and every one! And I congratulate you on the Civil Service Day of Ukraine., And, of course, the front. Knowing our heroes, and being grateful to them is a must., Today, I would like to pay particular attention to the soldiers of our 35th Separate Marine Brigade. A brigade that performs extremely difficult tasks. Guys who fight exactly the way Ukrainian soldiers should fight. Senior sailor Viacheslav Imanhulov and junior lieutenant Serhiy Penov – thank you, guys, for your exemplary strength and courage in the battles in Donetsk region. That's what our soldiers, Ukrainian soldiers, need to be. Well done!, And I ask each and every one: please honor the memory of our two paratroopers of the 35th Brigade. Especially brave, especially strong. They gave their lives for our state, for our people right now – in the battles in June, and Ukraine must remember them. Captain Ivan Kotsur... Eternal memory! Senior Lieutenant Oleksandr Kazandzhi... Eternal memory! May Ukraine's victory in this war and the successful transformation of our state institutions into ones as strong and effective as our soldiers are – may this be the best tribute to the memory of all our heroes of different times who fought and died for Ukraine's freedom and strength!, Glory to Ukraine!"
23 June 2023  - 16:45 ,Security is the first priority - address by the President of Ukraine following the NSDC meeting,", I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians!, I held the NSDC meeting. Three issues on the agenda. Most importantly, Ministers Klymenko and Kamyshin presented the first summary of the inspection of shelters in the regions of our country: Klymenko - across the country, Kamyshin - for Kyiv. In general, today we reviewed the situation with shelters in the regions, districts and cities most intensively terrorized by the enemy., The results are poor. Almost all over the country. This includes Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Konotop, Bila Tserkva, and many other cities. The situation is particularly cynical and shameful in those cities that have significant financial resources but, unfortunately, other priorities. There will be personnel decisions., Accessible and reliable shelters across the country should be and will be a priority for leaders at all levels. Security is the first priority., The Prosecutor General informed the NSDC about the legal action taken by the prosecutor's office to return the premises of the shelters that were illegally withdrawn from the ownership of the communities. To date, more than 400 such lawsuits have been filed across the country, and the work continues., Prime Minister Shmyhal also reported on the difficult situation with bridges and bridge crossings. The largest cities, including Kyiv. The situation is downright dangerous. The National Security and Defense Council has decided to set up a commission to inspect all bridges and overpasses across the country. Deputy Prime Minister Kubrakov is responsible for the inspection., , The second point on the agenda is courts., Deputy Prime Minister Stefanishyna informed the NSDC of the European Commission's interim verbal assessment of our institutional progress, particularly with regard to judicial reform., Indeed, a lot has been done. But we consider this only as a necessary basis for our own obligations to Ukrainians in terms of justice. Obviously, the case of the former President of the Supreme Court and other similar situations in the judicial system require a stricter state policy regarding the requirements for judges, for all those who work in the justice system, and their accountability for violations. For corruption violations., The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine appealed to the National Security and Defense Council. Today we considered the appeal. The Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, Ruslan Stefanchuk, and the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Legal Policy, Mr. Maslov, delivered reports., So, here are the proposals. To increase criminal liability for corruption offenses in the judiciary. And to make it tangible. From 10 to 15 years with confiscation of property. And this should apply to those who extort money, who take money, who maintain this system of corruption at all its levels., Next. There should be integrity checks of judges. And not only before appointment. Time can, unfortunately, change people about whom there was a positive conclusion at the beginning of their work in the courts. And I believe that it is worth checking, including with the use of a polygraph., Very importantly, we need to strengthen the role of the jury and expand the number of cases of its use in Ukraine. This is not only about democracy, it is about ensuring more justice., We also discussed the issue of protecting the rights of business and investors in courts. This is a fundamental task. A strong economy means secured investments and guaranteed protection of property rights. And it should be ensured. If we need a separate mechanism to protect business and investors' rights, we must ensure it. We have relevant proposals., Of course, we discussed the tasks that must be completed by the end of the year in order to fully implement each of the European Commission's recommendations for the start of negotiations on joining the European Union. The National Security and Defense Council gave the necessary protocol instructions in each of these areas. I am confident that all of them can be fulfilled., Today is exactly one year since Ukraine has become a candidate for accession to the European Union, and this year the goal is to start membership negotiations. Ukraine will definitely do its part., Glory to Ukraine!"
23 June 2023  - 12:26 ,"You are united by a common choice, high responsibility, courage, determination and loyalty to Ukraine, and in the future, you will all be united by victory – address by the President of Ukraine to the officers – graduates of military universities",", Dear attendees, ladies and gentlemen, generals, officers, sergeants, soldiers, lecturers and cadets!, What unites you all? What unites us all?, , In this address, among other things, I want to talk about this. And it's not just about today's graduation ceremony. Certainly, an important event for you and our country. It is also about the values we profess, the actions we take, the challenges we face, and the future that awaits us. What unites yesterday, today and tomorrow., The first is choice. The choice of your own destiny and your own path. Serving the state. Protecting Ukraine. The conscious choice of millions that makes everyone a single monolithic army, regardless of gender, age or status. Generals, officers, sergeants, soldiers, cadets. Many of you have participated in combat operations in the East even before you studied for your specialties and have relevant combat experience. From the very first hours of the full-scale war, you and your lecturers took up arms, reinforced the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and bravely stood up to defend Ukraine., This choice gives rise to the second thing that unites everyone. This is responsibility. The last years of your studies were the most difficult and life-changing for you., With the beginning of the large-scale invasion, under fire, you successfully moved the educational and scientific units to the places of temporary deployment. In a short time, you established the educational process. We withstood and prevented the occupier from seizing important centers and institutions, including military education institutions. And today, the officer corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is being joined by a worthy replenishment of officers who graduate from your educational institutions. And I want to mention each of them. To thank each of you. To express my wishes to everyone., I congratulate Ivan Kozhedub National Air Force University on this day! Dozens of officers and cadets of your university have mastered new weapons during their studies. Among them are Bayraktar, IRIS-T, NASAMS, Patriot and many others. We are confident that in the future there will be F-16s among them. We are confident that Ukrainian combat falcons will successfully cover our skies. We are confident that our air defense system will reliably protect us from enemy missiles and UAVs., All our people on the ground believe in you. May all the heavenly powers help you., I congratulate the Military Institute of Tank Troops on this day!, , From the first hours of the war, officers, sergeants and cadets of the Institute defended Kharkiv, performed tasks to strengthen the units of the Armed Forces and the National Guard of Ukraine, as part of tank, mechanized and rifle units, destroyed enemy manpower and equipment, together with other forces of the Kharkiv defense did not allow the occupiers to break into the city, and later participated in the liberation of many settlements in Kharkiv region., There is a saying about tankers: ""Those who forge victory with armor gloves on"". I sincerely wish that the day will come when you will be able to take off these gloves and hug your parents, your children, and all your loved ones., I congratulate the Kruty Heroes Military Institute of Telecommunications and Informatization!, From the beginning of the large-scale Russian aggression, the institute's military personnel took part in the defense of Kyiv, in particular the government quarter. For many years you have been training qualified specialists in information technology, electronic communications, and other military sciences. Immediately after the outbreak of war, you organized training for UAV operators of various types, mastering the latest communications equipment, and soon afterwards you opened a cyber lab and deployed a cyber intelligence training complex. I wish you success in your less visible, but no less important work. I wish you to ensure reliable communication and hear only good news about the small and big victories of our Homeland!, I sincerely congratulate the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy! And not only on this solemn day, because you have another reason for congratulations. This year, the Ukrainian Military Medical Academy celebrated its 30th anniversary. All this time, you have been training military doctors professionally and qualitatively for the needs of all branches and individual types of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - from among the officers. You save the lives of those who save the life of the country. You protect freedom and independence. I thank you for your important and difficult work. I wish you health and long life to you, your families and everyone you help on a daily basis., I congratulate the lecturers and students of the Military Training Department of the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine!, Together, you are training highly qualified veterinary specialists for the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other important formations. Today we are countering the enemy in all directions and with all our might. And when not only the military and equipment, but also the forces of nature, everything that exists on our land, take part in achieving a common victory. When not only people become heroes, and one of the symbols of resistance and service to the country is the already legendary dog Patron. And thousands of other animals who are helping in the battle against the Russian beast both on the frontline and in the rear. And it will definitely be defeated., I congratulate the Military Institute of Kyiv National University on this day!, Since February 24 last year, the Institute's servicemen have been defending the sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability of Kyiv as part of the Kyiv City Defense Forces, and despite constant missile and bomb attacks and artillery shelling by the enemy, they have been defending strategically important facilities., The Military Institute of the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv provides training in almost two dozen specialties and specializations. I wish all the graduates success and the soonest possible realization of the prophetic words of the Great Kobzar:, And on renewed holy land, Will be no enemy, no traitor,, But rather will be son and mother,, And people will be on the land., I thank all the lecturers and staff of each educational institution for the training, experience, and knowledge that your students have gained and are gaining. Yesterday they were cadets, soon they will become officers, tomorrow some of them will join the ranks of our country's defense forces, while others will continue their studies to join the ranks of the Ukrainian army after obtaining a master's degree., You are all united not only by a common choice and high responsibility. You are all united by courage, determination, patriotism, loyalty to Ukraine, readiness to defend it and the desire to liberate it., This means - and there is no doubt about it - that there is something that will unite everyone in the future. This is victory., And may you be united by Ukraine, its present, and its memory on your way to it. And so now I would like to honor the memory of all those who gave their lives for Ukraine in this Russian-Ukrainian war, the war for independence. I would like to honor them with a moment of silence., *, Thank you!, Glory to our Armed Forces!, Glory to our people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
22 June 2023  - 22:30 ,"Full de-occupation of the Zaporizhzhia NPP is a must, and anyone who turned a blind eye to its occupation by Russia is actually contributing to terror - address by the President of Ukraine",", Dear Ukrainians!, Today was a very busy day., First, we held a briefing for our partner countries on the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. There were representatives of the G7 and G20 countries, as well as representatives of international organizations. Here, in the Office. The MID, the Office's team, our diplomats provided the available information., Our principle is simple: the world must know what the occupier is preparing. Everyone who knows must act. Of course, after the Russian act of terrorism at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant and deliberate terrorist attacks on other dams and energy facilities, no one in the world should have any illusions about Russia anymore. It is Russia that is now the global center of cynicism, and any order for any evil that they hope to disguise as a disaster can come from there. The world has enough power to prevent any radiation incidents, let alone a radiation catastrophe. Everyone understands that the intelligence services of different countries can give appropriate signals and exert pressure. This is necessary., We will continue to inform our partners. We will also provide information to those countries that are pretending to be neutral even now. Obviously, radiation does not ask who is neutral and can reach anyone in the world. Accordingly, anyone in the world can help now, and it is quite clear what to do., Full de-occupation of the Zaporizhzhia NPP is a must. And anyone who turns a blind eye to Russia's occupation of such a facility, to Russia's mining of the territory and facilities of the nuclear power plant, is actually contributing not only to this Russian evil, but also to terror in general. And today I have instructed Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Ihor Klymenko to take all the necessary measures, to conduct all the necessary explanatory work with our people about all the existing risks. And this will be done in the near future., Today, we discussed relevant security issues with the intelligence service, the Security Service of Ukraine and the Ministry of Internal Affairs - both those related to the Zaporizhzhia plant and those related to the consequences of the Russian terrorist attack at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. We are doing our best to engage as many forces and means as possible to put pressure and influence on the terrorist state. There was also a separate report by the Minister of Internal Affairs on support for people and life in Kherson region and other areas of our South that suffered from the destruction of the Kakhovka reservoir., Of course, we also have information about what is happening in the occupied part of Kherson region. For this, even the word ""catastrophe"" is not enough. The Russian evil has formed special groups there to remove and, obviously, hide the bodies of the dead. This is not the first time Russia has done this - it is trying to destroy evidence and traces of its crimes in the occupied territory. They did this in Mariupol and other places. But this is a truth that cannot be hidden. And I thank everyone who helps our intelligence, our special services to get the necessary information!, I also held a meeting on the spiritual independence of Ukraine - we continue to work on this, and we will take new steps. Obviously, there can be no true spiritual ties with a terrorist state and those who justify the murder of Ukrainians and cover up evil. Every day and every night of Russian terror proves this. And we will reach the point where all dependencies on Russia, which someone somewhere is trying to manipulate, will be destroyed., One more thing., Today I would like to express my special gratitude to all those who, even in such times and circumstances, are investing their efforts to ensure that our people and our country have their own cultural strength. Today, another Book Arsenal has begun its work in Kyiv. ""Arsenal"" is the word that best characterizes the meaning of culture. It is what makes people human, what makes humanity stronger. It is what protects and spreads our experience through time - of each and every one of us, of our entire nation, of our entire Ukraine, of our entire Europe, of our entire humanity. Please, if you have the opportunity, visit the Book Arsenal these days and always support the cultural power., I thank everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine! I thank everyone who is now in combat - in the South, in the East, in Zaporizhzhia, in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Thank you!, Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine and defends life and humanity with us!, Glory to Ukraine!"
22 June 2023  - 11:53 ,"President of Ukraine: Russia is considering a scenario of a terrorist attack at the Zaporizhzhia NPP with radiation leakage, the world must act",", Dear Ukrainians!, And all the people of the world., All of them - I emphasize this., We have just had a report from our intelligence and the Security Service of Ukraine. Two points. The Russian terrorist attack at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant that took place. And another terrorist attack, which, unfortunately, is being prepared by the Russian occupiers, at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant., Regarding Kakhovka. Ukrainian intelligence and the Security Service of Ukraine have gathered new evidence of how Russian terrorists blew up the dam and other structures of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. It was an absolutely deliberate, premeditated crime. In the occupied territory, at a plant that was under the full control of the occupiers. And, importantly, last year we warned the world that Russia was preparing such a terrorist attack., We warned them when we received the first confirmed information about the mining of the hydroelectric power plant., Now concerning the Zaporizhzhia NPP. I remind those who have forgotten: this is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Everyone in the world - the IAEA, all countries, all leaders - knows exactly what is happening there., Russia uses the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as an element in its aggression. It occupies the plant. It uses it to cover the shelling of neighboring cities. It keeps weapons and troops there., Now our intelligence has received information that Russia is considering a scenario of a terrorist attack at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. A terrorist attack with radiation leakage. They have prepared everything for this. , Unfortunately, I have repeatedly had to remind that radiation has no state borders. And who it will hit is determined only by the wind direction… , We share all available information with our partners – everyone in the world. All the evidence. Europe, America, China, Brazil, India, the Arab world, Africa – all countries, absolutely everyone should know this. International organizations. Absolutely everyone. , There should never be any terrorist attacks on nuclear power plants anywhere. This time it should not be like with Kakhovka – the world has been warned, so the world can and must act., Glory to Ukraine!"
22 June 2023  - 09:36 ,"We must become a global community, so that peace for every nation is fully guaranteed - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the Organization of American States",", Dear Mr. Secretary-General!, Dear members of the General Assembly! , Thank you for the opportunity to address you. , And the main thing I would like to talk about today is collectivity., Eight months ago, I addressed your Organization for the first time, and I am grateful for all the support that you, both as an Organization and as countries, have given to our people, to our right to live freely. , The vast majority of you support UN General Assembly resolutions that defend a rules-based international order. And your personal position, Mr. Almagro, serves precisely to protect the key foundations of international relations – the equality of all nations and guarantees for every nation that its destiny will not be broken by other states through military or political violence., Our common goal, of all leaders and states that truly value human life, is a world in which violence does not dominate… A world in which the UN Charter is truly respected by everyone, from the smallest to the largest countries. A world in which not only no new frozen conflicts arise, but in which the majority of nations realize that any war is a common global challenge – a threat to the world, and not the suffering of only those against whom this aggression is committed., And have we become closer to such a world since my first address to you? I am sure we have., Although Russian aggression still goes on, although Russia does not stop even in the face of catastrophic crimes of ecocide... Probably, you all heard that this month Russian occupiers blew up the dam and other structures of the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant and destroyed one of the largest reservoirs in Europe,, deliberately flooding a huge area... Dozens of cities and villages were under water. , The one in Russia who gave the order to destroy the dam and the Kakhovka reservoir understood what he was doing… Understood that it would leave entire regions of our country without drinking water… Understood that thousands and thousands of hectares of fertile soil would become a desert... God forbid that anyone in the world faces such a crime., But despite this and all other Russian terrorist attacks, we are still pushing the aggressor to defeat – both by force of arms and by force of diplomacy., Ladies and Gentlemen!, Last year, I presented the Ukrainian Peace Formula, and since then, we have already involved dozens of nations in working on its implementation. We are also preparing the Global Peace Summit, which will specifically determine which state will help in which point of the Peace Formula. There is no alternative to it!, Russia has brought war to the territory of our country, Russian missiles and artillery are burning our cities and villages, Russian ecocides are destroying the nature of our country... So, it is Ukrainians who best understand what exactly needs to be done to restore peace. But to indeed restore peace, we need collective efforts. And of course – in particular, your support, your leadership., I invite you to work with us and all the free nations of the world on implementation of the Peace Formula. And I invite you to join the preparation of the Global Peace Summit. We must become a global community in the full sense of this word, so that peace for every nation is fully guaranteed. One cannot protect peace on his own, but war cannot overcome the collective desire for peace. May your power become the power of peace, too!, Thank you for your attention! Long live freedom!, Слава Україні!"
21 June 2023  - 22:32 ,"It is our state that global hopes are focused on, and our people will justify them: Ukraine will win – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, First. Front. Fierce battles. South – we're destroying the enemy. Donetsk direction – we're destroying the enemy. The Kupiansk direction – whatever the Russian terrorists are planning there, we will destroy the enemy., In the South, we are advancing. Thank you, warriors! In the East, our defenses are firming. And I am especially grateful, guys, for every shot down Russian helicopter... Each shooting down is important., Second. London. Our special Ukraine Recovery Conference organized with the British began today., Thank you, the United Kingdom, for the new financial support package. Thank you, the United States, for the package for our infrastructure and energy. Thank you, the European Union, for the EUR 50 billion financial instrument presented by President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen for our reconstruction., The purpose of this Conference in London is not simply to generate the efforts of our partner states, but also to have international business support for our transformation. Currently, a Ukrainian delegation is working in the UK – the government, the Office, the Verkhovna Rada, the public sector. Every aspect of Ukrainian recovery and further development of our state will be presented to those global business figures whose attention we directly need: our industries, cities, communities, the country in general. Ukraine's task is to transform the moral leadership of our people into the economic leadership of our country. All the prerequisites for this exist, first of all, in our people, in our beautiful strong nation., Third. A new package of EU sanctions against Russia is finally being approved. Part of its norms was prepared based on the proposals of the International Sanctions Group chaired by Michael McFaul and Andriy Yermak. This package will further limit Russia's profits it has received in Europe so far, and will also block some of the routes to bypass the previously introduced sanctions. This is now one of the priority tasks., All our partners are fully aware of how crucial it is to block all avenues to circumvent sanctions. The terrorist state still has access to various products and components, technological and financial schemes, created by those in the world who still value freedom and international law., Russia must be in complete isolation while Russia's main export products are evil and death., And one more., I accepted credentials from ambassadors of foreign countries who arrived in Ukraine. Norway, Switzerland, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Iceland. New ambassadors. In general, more than 60 embassies and representative offices of states and more than 20 representative offices of international organizations operate in our country., To work in Ukraine, to work with Ukraine, is to believe in Ukraine and Ukrainians. The world is with us despite everything the evil state tries to do against us. The 483rd day of the full-scale war. It is our state that global hopes are focused on. And our people will justify these hopes. Freedom will win. Ukraine will win., I thank everyone who fights and works for Ukraine!, Glory to all who strengthen freedom!, Glory to Ukraine!,  "
21 June 2023  - 14:51 ,"When we build Ukraine, we will build freedom – online speech by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London",", Thank you very much!, Happy to see you, Rishi, Mr. Prime Minister!, Thank you for your kind words about Ukraine, about our soldiers, and thanks for your leadership and support the UK provides to Ukraine., Thank you that we are really united in defending freedom., Dear leaders of politics, business and public opinion!, Dear Presidents, Prime Ministers, Ministers, Secretaries, CEOs and heads of international organizations!, And, of course, dear journalists!, When we are talking about recovery, we are talking about millions of jobs, billions in corporate profits and trillions of GDPs. And not only for Ukraine, but for all our countries – mine and yours. Countries that want and will live freely despite any predatory ambitions of various ""putins"", whose brains are poisoned by dreams of war., Growth is always based on values. Just as strong investments are preceded by trust, so the growth that we are preparing must be preceded by confidence that what has been rebuilt will not fall. And it's not about bricks, but about life in general., , The world is abundant with ruins reminding us of the wars of the past. And politics in different regions, unfortunately, is abundant with sick ideas of hatred and resentment, which point to possible wars in the future. And although no one has the power to cleanse the depths of human nature from the evil that sometimes rises to the surface and destroys and kills... But you and I, and right now, we are able to protect life and overcome the ruins after the Russian aggression in such a way as to block the path for evil – meaning for any new aggressions., The eyes of the world are looking at us. And at whether we will defeat Russian aggression exactly as freedom deserves to win – that is, without compromising our values. Also the world is watching to see if we will restore normal life in such a way that our transformation will land an ideological defeat on the aggressor., We protect Ukraine and thus we protect freedom, and when we build Ukraine – we’ll build freedom. Country, region, continent, world… It’s a global task., And I want to thank you. And, of course, I thank Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy – every country where we have agreed on key principles for recovery. At this Conference, we must move from vision to agreements, and from agreements to real projects., There is a Ukrainian delegation in London that will present concrete things that we propose to do together. In my turn, I will outline five directions in which we have begun to create foundations for peace. , The first is the potential of unity. The second is the potential of stability. The third is growth potential. The fourth is security potential. And the fifth – extremely important – is the potential of democracy., So, the first point – we are strengthening unity., Ukraine has already succeeded in making the EU as united as it has never been before. This is truly a unity of values, which is reflected in many political, economic, sanction and humanitarian decisions. Ukraine has activated all that power of solidarity for which the EU was conceived., And Ukraine is also activating the moral force of NATO. This is important for all of us. What does the world see now? Does it recognize NATO's moral leadership in protecting peace? This is only possible with Ukraine in the Alliance., Just as Ukraine already belongs to the value space of the EU, we already belong to the NATO security space. De facto. Just as Ukraine is already part of the EU's common market and on its way to full membership, we are already defending the common space of freedom in the Alliance and are only waiting for the courage of the Alliance leaders to recognize this reality politically., Thanks to the same values, we are developing strong bilateral alliances with such leaders of the democratic world as the United Kingdom, the USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, all the EU members. And this gives us new power in defense, economy and global prospects for democracy., We build our alliances and thus we are safeguarding the level of freedom to which our people are used to., , Second – we are strengthening stability., At least 600 million consumers around the world directly depend on our agricultural production. This is a huge potential for food security., At the times of this war, when Russia blocked our ports and destroyed freedom of navigation in the Black and Azov Seas, the world saw what Ukrainian grain is. Without it, there is a threat of price crises and social collapse in different countries., We have now partially restored the movement of our agricultural products by sea through two export initiatives. And this is stability for a huge social and economic space – from Morocco to Somalia, from China to Lebanon, from Türkiye to India, from Spain to Pakistan. Different aspects, different influences, but always a contribution to stability., Another similar area is the energy sector., I believe that there is no alternative to the green transformation of the economy, and Russian aggression has proven that green transformation is one of the key foundations of security. Each strike on our energy facilities and each manifestation of Russian blackmail with the energy crisis ends the era of fossil fuel dominance and old energy habits, when entire regions could depend on a single supplier, such as Russia., It is green energy that guarantees real energy stability. Ukraine can be – and will be! – one of the key suppliers of clean electricity and green hydrogen to Europe. The potential of this industry alone is about four hundred billion dollars., We build agricultural and energy facilities in Ukraine and thus we’re protecting the world from chaos., Third point – we strengthen the growth. , There is currently no place in the world where there is a need to construct and rebuild as many objects as in Ukraine. Every new day of Russian aggression brings new ruins. Thousands and thousands of destroyed houses, devastated industries, burnt lives… Recently, Russia committed also the largest crime of ecocide in Europe by blowing up the dam and other structures of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant. , What does all this mean? In Ukraine, there is the largest source of economic, industrial and technological growth in Europe for decades and decades. And, by the way, it's not only reconstruction., For example, the green transformation of energy logically stimulates the development of industries such as green metallurgy and green fertilizers. Thanks to its natural resources and industrial traditions, Ukraine can become one of the key global centers of green metallurgy. In addition, we have significant reserves of critical resources for the modern economy, such as lithium. , By building with Ukraine and in Ukraine, we fend off our countries and our countries' companies from recessions., Fourth point – we strengthen security. , This war demonstrates what effective defense against aggression in the modern world means… , , What weapons are needed and to what extent, what infrastructure is lacking and what production is a priority, what technologies save lives on a large scale, and what systems make it possible to make science fiction a reality on the battlefield. From the production of combat drones to conventional artillery, from an air shield that covers the entire country or even a region to shelters in every school, from infrastructure that is built so that it cannot be destroyed by the Iranian ""Shaheds"" to cyberspace that remains resilient even in the face of constant cyberattacks., We are doing all of this in Ukraine, and we need the experience of partners in all of this. We build security together and thus we convince the world that democracies cannot be defeated., And finally, the fifth point – democracy., Russia invaded Ukraine not only to steal our land, resources and people. It is obvious that without Ukraine there can be no Russian Empire. , And it is equally obvious that Russia's bosses are very afraid of our democracy. Why? Because democracy paves the way for the rule of law, getting rid of corruption and to the key principle of our countries – every person matters. It is very important., Of course, democracy is in the nature of Ukrainians. And we would strengthen it anyway, no matter what they think or do in Russia. , But we all have to realize that the more democracy we have, the greater its strength in our entire region. The more rule of law we have, the more law will work here on the eastern flank of Europe. And the more transparent Ukraine is, the uglier any corruption model will look in Russia., Even Russia's full-scale aggression has not stopped our internal reforms., Ukraine will be associated with a fair court, just as it is now associated with courage. Step by step, we will get there., Thanks to digital transformation, we will show the world how the state can function effectively without any contact between an official and a citizen or a company. All public services can and will be transferred online – from business registration or social assistance to any other public service. And we are already exporting our digitalization to other regions and other countries. We have started such cooperation with Estonia and will continue with Colombia and Zambia. And I am sure that this is just the beginning. Please be sure to ask our team, our government officials for more details about this… this is truly an example of social progress through technology. , , Even before February 24th, we started dismantling the old oligarchic model of economic relations from the post-Soviet period. And this is not just something about the personalities of the oligarchs, it is about changing the approach to economic relations. Financial transparency and banking system resilience, market liberalization and competition stimulation, guaranteeing equal and legal conditions for every economic entity – are all areas in which we made progress before February 24 and which are very important now., We build institutions and continue reforms in Ukraine and thus we are defending democracy and preserving it as a hope for all, at least in our region, that democracy will prevail., Ladies and Gentlemen!, By building Ukraine, we are building much more than one country. We build the world as it will be during the lifetime of our generation and after us. Will it be peaceful? Will it be stable? Will it be democratic? , It depends on each and everyone of us. , I invite all of you to Ukraine! By the way, Prime Minister Rishi, we have not seen each other in Kyiv for quite a while… , Thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support! , Thank you UK!, Слава Україні!"
20 June 2023  - 22:01 ,A rebuilt and strengthened Ukraine means protection against all forms of Russian terror - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", I wish you health, dear Ukrainians!, A brief report on this day., First of all, I thank our Air Force and all the defenders of the sky from our other defense forces for every downed Russian missile and Shahed. Last night alone, more than 30 Shaheds were shot down. These are hundreds of saved lives, saved infrastructure. Thank you, warriors!, Second. Today in Kherson, rescuers were injured as a result of the occupiers' shelling... They were relieving the consequences of the Russian act of terrorism at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant and were shelled by Russian artillery. Eight SES workers were injured, one, unfortunately, was killed... My condolences to their families and friends! Ukrainian warriors will definitely give the terrorists a response to all this meanness., Every such Russian strike, every Russian terrorist attack is an argument that the occupiers have no chance of staying anywhere on Ukrainian soil. There is no place here for murderers and terrorists and there will never be., Now our warriors in the south and in the east are very actively destroying the enemy, physically clearing Ukraine. This will continue in the future., Protection against terror means the destruction of terrorists. And it is a guarantee that the evil state will never again have the opportunity to bring evil to Ukraine. This is what the third point is about today. The first meetings have already begun in London in the framework of the conference on Ukraine's recovery, which we have been preparing together with our British friends. Discussions have already taken place in Switzerland and Germany, in France and Italy. There is work at various levels for our recovery. And we are directing this work in such a way that our reconstruction, our recovery will become not only construction projects, but also a global project of protection., A rebuilt Ukraine, a transformed Ukraine, a strengthened Ukraine is a carrier of security and a guarantor of security, it is protection against any form of Russian terror and protection against any repetition of Russian aggression., Tomorrow at the London conference, I will present some aspects of our philosophy of Ukraine's transformation. The full vision will be presented later this month. And already in Ukraine., Together with our partners and all of us here at home in Ukraine, we must ensure that only security, freedom and peace will come after us., I thank everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine! I thank each of our warriors who are now in combat, at combat posts and on combat missions! Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk region - well done, guys!, I am grateful to everyone who trains our soldiers and helps us with weapons! Ukraine uses every weapon and every shell as efficiently as possible and always to protect lives., Glory to Ukraine!"
19 June 2023  - 22:16 ,The evil state has no such fortifications or reserves that will stop Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, A report on this day., The Staff. First of all, the frontline, specific issues of the offensive. There were reports from senior commanders and commanders directly from the battlefields. There was also a report by the Commander-in-Chief, the Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate., Separately and in detail, we considered the preparation and provision of equipment for the new brigades of the National Guard and our border guards - those who are waiting for their time to engage in combat operations., In some areas our warriors are moving forward, in some areas they are defending their positions and resisting the occupiers' assaults and intensified attacks. We have no lost positions. Only liberated ones. They have only losses. In general, it is a situation of pressure, our pressure, which allows us to pave the way for our flag. Blue and yellow colors will be all over our south and all over our east. And the evil state has no such fortifications or reserves that will stop Ukraine. Because we are on our own land, and this gives us the greatest strength., I thank all of our warriors - every soldier, every sergeant, every officer and every general who are involved in our active offensive and defensive actions now. I thank you for each liberated and each defended position!, Today, in a conversation with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, I outlined our current defense needs and thanked him for the defense support provided. For example, the British Storm Shadow long-range missiles are doing a very useful and accurate job at the front. As well as many other weapons supplied by the British. And this cooperation will have a significant continuation., Of course, we discussed with Rishi, with Mr. Prime Minister, the preparations for the NATO Summit in Vilnius and the content of this meeting of the Alliance., Today, there is also a significant political decision by the UK regarding sanctions - to maintain sanctions against Russia until the aggressor compensates for all the damage done to our people and our country. And it is very important that the assets of the aggressor state and all those associated with it, associated with the system of domination that the Kremlin has built on the territory of Russia, are used to compensate for the damage caused by the Russian war and terror. This will be fair, and I am grateful to all British people who support us on the path to justice., We also discussed with Rishi the preparations for the conference on Ukraine's reconstruction in London. It will take place in the coming days, and we expect it to consolidate various international efforts, including those of big business, to support our recovery. A recovery that should demonstrate to the world that freedom is invincible., I discussed the conference, financial cooperation, and our movement towards the EU with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. This week we are expecting an interim verbal assessment of our work on the European Commission's recommendations. We discussed sanctions issues in detail, in particular the 11th sanctions package against Russia for the war., Today I also spoke with Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte and Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen. As always, we paid attention to the frontline and our joint defense efforts, and I thanked them for their support and willingness to develop our cooperation for security., I informed them about the talks with African leaders and representatives who visited Ukraine last week and then visited the terrorist state. Each such international step only convinces again and again that the world should work more actively with the Peace Formula. Because this is the only Formula that responds comprehensively enough to every aspect of Russian madness., And one more thing., The World Bank. I spoke with the President of the Bank today. And not only about cooperation now, but also about the post-war transformation of Ukraine. About the decisions and steps, about the new doctrine of a new Ukraine, a victorious Ukraine, steps that we will prepare and implement. All together. Just as we are now overcoming this aggression together., I am grateful to everyone who is now in combat, at combat posts, in combat positions!, Today I would like to highlight the Artan assault unit of the Main Intelligence Directorate and its commander, Major Torkotiuk. Thank you!, And also our Special Operations Forces. Viktor, all the guys - thank you very much!, Thank you to everyone who is fighting and working for Ukraine!, Glory to Ukraine!"
18 June 2023  - 22:31 ,"Our troops are advancing, step by step we are moving forward - address by the President of Ukraine",", I wish you health, dear Ukrainians!, This week is coming to an end - a very important week for all of us, for our defense, for our steps forward, for our offensive actions. And it is time to thank all our warriors. Those who have distinguished themselves this week., The Tavria direction is the toughest. Marines of the 35th separate brigade - thank you! Paratroopers of the “Seventy-ninth” - thank you! The 130th separate reconnaissance separate battalion - thank you! The 68th separate hunting brigade - thank you! The 23rd separate mechanized brigade - thank you! Artillerymen of the 44th brigade - thank you!, I would like to especially mention the company of attack drones of the 47th separate mechanized brigade led by Chief Sergeant Rustam Mustafayev. Thank you for the result, warriors! The crew of the armored demining vehicle of the 70th separate support regiment - Senior Sergeant Mykola Nikandrov and Junior Sergeant Roman Lisin. Well done, guys!, Our National Guard - thank you all! And I would like to particularly mention Senior Sergeant Vasyl Kovylin and Platoon Commander Denys Zeleny, the 4th operational battalion, the 1st presidential brigade of the National Guard. Thank you! The guys are performing tasks in Luhansk region - near Bilohorivka., Our border guards... I would like to mention the Lutsk and Lviv border guard detachments in particular. Senior Soldier Vasyl Kutsyk, Avdiivka direction, is very effective in repelling attacks. Thank you! Sergeant Vadym Druzhyna, Siversk direction, successfully ""subtracts"" enemy soldiers and equipment. Thank you!, And of course, our defenders of the sky. Over a week, more than a hundred group air strikes on enemy positions and rear. Thank you, our pilots! Almost three dozen missiles and about fifty attack drones were destroyed in seven days. And I would like to celebrate the defenders of the Kyiv region's sky, the 96th Kyiv air defense missile brigade of the Air Force... Thank you! All ""Kalibrs"" and ""Kinzhals"" were destroyed during these attacks, and thus the lives of our people were saved., And by the way, I want to say a few things. First of all, no matter who in Russia says that our Patriots have been destroyed, they are still here, they are working, all of them are shooting down Russian missiles. As efficiently as possible. Not a single Patriot has been destroyed!, Secondly, you all saw how the visit of the delegation of African leaders and representatives went - a visit to Ukraine, and then a visit to the terrorist state. The delegation had the opportunity to see who is really interested in peace and who himself embodies war, it was very clear. Everything that was discussed in Ukraine was about the Peace Formula. Point by point. The whole content. Everything that was said in Russia was about war, about how to continue destroying lives. It is obvious that there is no alternative to the Peace Formula. It is good that the world hears and sees this more and more., Third, as for the terrorist state. Their only concern now should be how to prepare their society, Russian society, to the fact that they will lose everything they are destroying the future of their state for. Russia will lose the occupied territories. There is no and will be no alternative to our steps for de-occupation., Our troops are advancing, position by position, step by step, we are moving forward, This week, we had Ramstein, and the main thing is the speed of supply. Next week, we will have new important communications with our partners, for the sake of our movement, for the sake of weapons, for the sake of our warriors having everything they need., I am grateful to everyone who is now in combat, in positions and at combat posts! , I thank everyone who helps!, Glory to Ukraine!"
17 June 2023  - 21:58 ,I would like to thank all partners who this week took new steps in supporting our state and people – address of President of Ukraine,", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, I want to thank today.

16 June 2023  - 22:54 ,"Each of our soldiers, each new step, each meter of Ukrainian land freed from the enemy is the most important thing – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Dear Ukrainians, dear Ukrainian women!, Today was a long day. With many events, and a lot of news. Meeting in a special format – Ukraine and African countries. Long discussions... The Peace Formula, security issues, grain, our joint capabilities to protect the principles and goals of the UN Charter, to protect nations from aggression. I called on the leaders and states of Africa to participate in the Global Peace Summit we are preparing. Ukraine will be heard all over the world, and we will involve the whole world in the implementation of the Peace Formula. It is not easy, but we are working., Today was also the graduation from the National Defense University of Ukraine. I had the honor to congratulate our officers. I was very pleased to do it., I am especially grateful to our air defense forces – everyone who defends the Ukrainian sky. The downing of Russian missiles today, including six ballistic missiles, is very important and symbolic. No one can be intimidated by Russia., And there was another event today, another point in my schedule that has not yet been announced. This is the War Cabinet. Our commanders – generals Syrsky, Tarnavsky, Zaluzhny, Shaptala. And our commanders in specific directions of active actions - I won't say their names yet, everything in its own time. Our advancement is the most important thing. Each of our soldiers, each of our new steps, and each meter of Ukrainian land freed from the enemy is the most important thing. And there was Budanov... Separate steps., I'm thankful to everyone who is now fighting for Ukraine!, I'm thankful to everyone who is preparing to enter the battle!, And I'm thankful to everyone who helps us so much, potently!, Glory to Ukraine!, We will defeat everyone!"
15 June 2023  - 22:31 ,"Another Ramstein today was quite productive, we are getting even stronger – address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, A report for today. First, we have significant international steps that strengthen our position in several areas at once., The European Parliament has adopted a powerful resolution in support of our nation's European and Euro-Atlantic aspirations. There is a concrete call to the leaders of the European Union to define a clear path for our country's membership in the EU., And on the issue of the Alliance, the European Parliament sets exactly the meaning of our Ukrainian contribution to Euro-Atlantic security, which envisages that Ukraine's path to NATO and a political invitation to accession should be developed in the context of preparations for the Alliance Summit in Vilnius already. The time for integration and security certainty has obviously come, and I thank all members of the European Parliament and the President of the European Parliament, Mrs. Roberta Metsola, as well as Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk for the constant and effective work with the parliaments of our partner countries., The second significant international step today is the bill registered in the United States on the confiscation and transfer to our country of the assets of the Russian state - a terrorist state - as reparations. I thank the U.S. Senators for the strong bipartisan support of this issue of justice for Ukraine and all victims of Russian terror., In dictatorships like Russia's, money is the highest value. And especially for those who serve the ruling regime or are actually the owners of state structures., When the terrorist state and all Russian individuals whose collaboration with the Kremlin created the conditions for Russian aggression or who are a public cover for Russian corrupt officials lose their money, a very important goal will be achieved - they will feel what loss is. They do not respect life and do not feel regret when human lives are lost. The Russian ruling class does not value people and is willing to waste human lives by the hundreds of thousands. But they do care about money - the money they have appropriated, by the way. They value their assets. They must lose them completely, and in favor of those who suffered from their aggression, from this terrorist war, in favor of our state, our people., Today I continued to address the parliaments of our partner countries., I called on the parliamentarians and people of Switzerland to continue to stand in unity and solidarity with us in the defense of common values and freedom. It is very important that all of us in Europe equally understand that it is only by force of arms that we can now protect the way of life that we all value so much, in all countries - from the Atlantic area to Ukraine, including Switzerland. It is our common task to defend freedom, international law and human life., I also had phone calls with representatives of two countries - Belize and Costa Rica. We are building new partnerships for Ukraine to support the Peace Formula and our resolutions at the UN in defense of the UN Charter and international law in general. I discussed with Mr. President of Costa Rica and Mr. Prime Minister of Belize the possibility of organizing a meeting between Ukraine and Latin America. Together we can provide much more protection for the freedom and equality of nations in the modern world., An important report was made today on the situation in Kherson region and in the south of the country, in our Dnipropetrovsk region, after the Russian act of terrorism at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. Disaster relief, humanitarian aid, drinking water supply and all other sensitive and important issues. Prime Minister Shmyhal, Minister of Internal Affairs Klymenko, specialized Deputy Head of the Office Kuleba, and representatives of local authorities. Another report was on the situation in Kryvyi Rih and Odesa after the recent terrorist attacks., And, of course, the frontline. I thank all our warriors, every unit, every combat brigade for today - for today's battles., I would like to mention six units in particular. The Khortytsia operational and strategic group of troops - paratroopers of our powerful 80th separate airborne assault brigade. The Tavria operational and strategic group of troops - warriors of our 23rd separate mechanized brigade, marines of the 35th and 37th separate brigades, warriors of the 128th separate mountain assault brigade of Zakarpattia and the 128th separate brigade of the territorial defense forces... Thank you all, guys, for your efficiency! For your strength, courage and for returning Ukrainian land to Ukraine and strengthening our Ukrainian will., Glory to everyone who is now in combat, at combat posts and on combat missions! Glory to all who train our warriors! Who treats and rehabilitates our defenders after their injuries!, I am grateful to everyone in the world who helps. And by the way, another Ramstein today was quite productive. We are getting even stronger!, Glory to Ukraine!"
15 June 2023  - 19:49 ,"By supporting Ukraine, the world supports protection from war, because the source of aggression is outside our borders - Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address to the Federal Assembly and the people of the Swiss Confederation",", Thank you very much, Mr. Candinas, Mr. Speaker, for your kind words about Ukraine and our defense., Now, as we defend the lives of our people from Russian strikes and overcome the consequences of the terrible crimes of this war, including the largest ecocide in Europe, we need maximum unity. The unity of all those who share with us the key values - the value of life, the value of freedom, the value of law and the value of respect for every nation, every community and every person. When unity is at its highest, solidarity is also most effective. And when it is, life, freedom, law, and respect will definitely prevail., And today I am addressing you to talk about this unity., Dear members of the Federal Assembly! , Dear people of Switzerland!, The soul of the values that unite us is peace. Peace! Ukraine has never been the source of any wars of aggression. And even now, although it sounds somewhat paradoxical, the Ukrainian land is a territory of peace, because the source of this war, the source and cause of aggression, is outside our borders., , Just imagine this... Every night, instead of going to sleep normally, our people check the news to see if there are warnings that Russian bombers are approaching the point of launching missiles over the Caspian Sea or elsewhere. This is more than 1,500 kilometers from our land! This is where the war takes wings. And when it is clear that there will be another Russian missile, another Russian attack, people immediately put their children to bed, for example, in a corridor where there are no windows and therefore it is safer, or go to a shelter., Imagine what it is like to live in communities that border Russia. Our border - three regions - is constantly suffering from purely terrorist attacks from Russian territory. Almost every night and every day. Towns, villages, houses, schools, churches, markets, businesses - everything... They are shelled across the border from Russian territory with artillery or mortars, missiles or guided bombs... This is death or the threat of death that comes to our land from Russia., Hundreds of Ukrainian families have lost their loved ones due to strikes by Iranian kamikaze drones – Shaheds, dozens of which the Russians launch at our cities almost every night. Fortunately, thanks to the defense assistance of our partners - and we are grateful for it - we are now able to shoot down most of the Shaheds. But, unfortunately, not all of them... They take the lives of our people and constantly destroy our infrastructure! And all this is also death that came from Russia., There is absolutely nothing in this brutal war that is taking place on our land that would make our land, our people, our Ukraine a source of war or the territory of those who want to take something from another nation. We are defending the lives of our people, our freedom, our independence, our values... Peace for Ukrainian children! It is to our peaceful land that those who burn towns and villages and turn everything they touch into black ruins came. It is from Russia that those who still occupy the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and cynically use it as a cover for the constant shelling of our cities came to Ukraine. It is from Russia that those who blew up the dam and other structures of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant came to Ukraine, causing a man-made disaster and a colossal crime against people and nature, and they did it exactly on the occupied territory…, Any unbiased view will confirm one thing - if war had not been brought from Russia to our peaceful Ukrainian land, there would have been no war. The source of evil and death is outside our borders. By supporting us, the world supports protection from war. That is why solidarity with our people is shown, in particular, even by those nations with which we had no meaningful relations before February 24, 2022, when Russia turned its hybrid aggression against our country into an open full-scale genocidal war., , I am grateful for every package of sanctions against Russia that curbs Russia's terrorist potential. I thank the world for every piece of weaponry that helps save people from Russian terror! I am grateful for every frozen asset of the Russian state and those individuals whose collaboration with the Kremlin has turned Russia into a terrorist state…, All this helps curb the aggression - weapons for us, ever-increasing sanctions against Russia that prevent it from adapting to the world's pressure, and justice for Ukrainians and the world. Justice, which we are bringing closer by establishing the Tribunal for Russian aggression., I am grateful to you, Switzerland, for not remaining indifferent to the suffering that Russia is bringing to our land with its aggression. You supported the joint European sanctions against Russia, and this is an important solidarity, because sanctions bring the end of this aggression closer. They should be intensified., I know that you are having a discussion about permits to re-export weapons to protect Ukraine. And I want every participant in the discussion to remember one fact: we are asking the world for weapons to make our Ukrainian territory a territory of peace again. All our land, all our people... Only for this! Exactly as envisaged by international law. Exactly as Mr. Speaker said at the beginning: a rules-based international order must guarantee freedom for every nation., We are not a source of aggression, not a territory of war, and not some kind of conflict zone. We are a country that has always valued and will always value peace, and you know it. Our peace can only withstand such aggression by force of arms., Last year, in the autumn, at the G19 Summit, I presented the Ukrainian Peace Formula. Different states and leaders are already involved in efforts to implement the Formula. It is designed so that everyone in the world can choose the component of restoring peace and security they can help implement most effectively. There are partners who have chosen radiation and food security. There are partners who are ready to help with the return of children who have been deported to the aggressor's territory by the Russian occupiers and are being kept away from their families and Ukraine. Thousands and thousands of children stolen by Russia! We must bring them all home, back to Ukraine. There are partners who are ready to help with the restoration of justice and protection from ecocide and mine clearance…, , In March, in our conversation with Mr. President of Switzerland, Mr. Berset, I presented the points of the Peace Formula and our approach to its implementation. And now I invite all of you, ladies and gentlemen, all of you, Switzerland, to join the preparation of the Global Peace Summit and show your leadership in the part of the Formula where you consider your national experience to be most useful for the world and peace., And one more thing., The world has gone through various wars, and the more wars destroyed life, the greater was the understanding that defense against aggression and prevention of aggression require collective efforts and solidarity. We are now defending ourselves against aggression that replicates the worst wars of the past and seeks the best technologies of our time to terrorize people, states, and even continents. Nothing but unity can stop it. In particular, our unity!, Thank you, Switzerland! , Thank you for your attention!, Glory to Ukraine!"
14 June 2023  - 23:19 ,"When the ruins disappear, it is not just the aggressor who loses, but the very idea of aggression - address by the President of Ukraine",", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, I have just spoken with President of Poland Andrzej Duda - an hour-long conversation, primarily on security issues. The current situation on the battlefield, weapons for our military, and ammunition. I thanked him for the fulfillment of previous defense agreements., Of course, in every conversation we pay considerable attention to long-term security and peace guarantees, and not only for us. And always effectively., Poland is quite realistic about the need for Ukraine's membership in NATO. And this is an objective need. We are jointly developing a concrete content for the NATO Summit in Vilnius. This is exactly the moment when Russian assumptions that someone in NATO is still afraid of Russia must be completely shattered. Such assumptions fuel Russia's aggressive ambitions. We must and can neutralize them. We thank Poland for its support for Ukraine and the real strengthening of NATO., Not only today, but throughout the week, we have been preparing very substantively for the Ukraine Recovery Conference to be held in London next week. This will be a significant event, very representative, which will unite both political and business efforts to restore our country and normal life for our people. The key Ukrainian principle is simple and fair, namely: no ruins will be left in Ukraine. We will rebuild everything, restore everything, and we know exactly what steps need to be taken in what timeframe and with what forces to defeat Russian aggression and rebuild our country. When the ruins disappear, it is not just the aggressor who loses, but the idea of aggression itself. And it will happen., Every day, in preparation for this London conference, we hold long and thorough preparatory meetings - all the necessary state institutions are involved, at different levels. And we are doing everything to ensure that the appropriate level of international agreements is prepared for our vision, the Ukrainian vision, which is, as always, meaningful., We continue our communication with partners on Russian missile production. Today, Russian savages launched another missile attack on Odesa with Kalibr missiles. Dozens of components of these Kalibr missiles were supplied to Russia from other countries. Obviously, each such supply route is a way to strengthen terror. The world has the tools to cut off all such routes - from every country, from every company whose components are used by Russian missile manufacturers, Today, I signed new decrees to honor our warriors with state awards, including the servicemen of the Air Force, our air defense, those heroes who save the lives of our people every night, every day. Also, our intelligence officers and servicemen of the Armed Forces - combat brigades and units - were awarded. In total, 331 warriors. 331 heroic lives., Please always remember that all of us in Ukraine owe our lives to those who stood up to defend the lives of our people and our independence. Respect for our warriors, respect for the families of our warriors, respect for the wives and husbands of all those who have stood up to defend the state is a must. Gratitude to these people is a must. Ukraine knows how to be grateful, and it should be shown every day., I thank everyone who is fighting and working for our victory. I am especially grateful to everyone who is currently fighting in the east and south of our country, opening up strategic space for Ukraine, space for movement to victory. I thank all those who are now on the offensive and on the defensive, who are storming the occupiers' positions and repelling their attacks. Thank you all, warriors, for your bravery, for your resilience and for every meter of progress!, Glory to our heroes! , Glory to Ukraine!"
13 June 2023  - 22:46 ,"Together with our partners, we must ensure such physical conditions that make Russian terror impossible - address by the President of Ukraine",", Fellow Ukrainians!, This afternoon, the rescue and rubble removal operations in Kryvyi Rih after a terrorist missile attack have been completed. Unfortunately, 11 people were killed, including one child... My condolences to the families and friends. In total, more than 30 people were injured. All of them are being provided with the necessary assistance., I would like to thank each and every person who took part in the rescue operation: rescuers, doctors, police, volunteers, local authorities, and ordinary citizens. Thank you for every life saved! Thank you for every person you helped today., This deliberate Russian strike on an ordinary city only proves a simple truth once again: together with our partners, we must ensure such physical conditions that make Russian terror impossible., The first is our sky shield. A sufficient number of air defense systems of sufficient capacity. Plus modern fighter jets. When the Russian ability to attack our cities and villages is physically limited by our sky shield, only then will the terrorist state realize that there are no alternatives to peace for all Ukrainians and defeat for Russia., The second is the destruction of the basis for terror, for the production of new missiles by a terrorist state. Unfortunately, Russia still has the ability to obtain critical components for missile production from companies around the world, including companies from some partner countries. These components are then shipped to Russia in various ways. If we take, for example, one of the missiles that hit Kryvyi Rih today, about 50 components in it - mostly microelectronics - were produced in other countries., And today, representatives of our state met with diplomats from the respective countries. All partners have a list of companies that supply Russia with components for murder. This list is available. Everyone in the world also understands how Russian terrorists are trying to deceive the world. And we are waiting for conclusions and swift action to stop Russian missile terror., Ukraine has imposed sanctions on all companies in Russia that produce missiles. Such complete sanctions should be imposed globally against all of them. Every way of circumventing sanctions should be appropriately punished at the global level as well. Export controls over critical components must be tightened as much as possible. If someone acts as an intermediary or works together with Russia so that terrorists can continue to blow up residential buildings and kill people, such entities - whether business or government - deserve a response from the world. A tough response. Our partners have all the information on this., It is definitely cheaper to cut terrorists off the supply of components for terror once and for all than to constantly spend more and more money on new air defense missiles., Today, we also held a meeting to ensure inevitable, legal and fair accountability of Russia for this aggression. We are working on several scenarios for creating a special tribunal for the crime of aggression. A crime for which the highest Russian leadership must be held accountable. The crime that gave rise to all other crimes of this war. And this accountability will surely come. Indeed, this is not an easy task. But Ukrainians have already accomplished so many difficult tasks that they will not only accomplish it for sure, but will do it with pleasure. There will be a tribunal., Today I met with IAEA Director General Grossi. We are working very actively to prevent any incidents at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP. As long as the invaders are there, there is a risk for the whole world, and this is obvious. Only complete de-occupation of the plant and its return to Ukrainian control can guarantee safety. And we will do everything for this., It's good that the IAEA is offering to send a group of experts to Ukraine to assess the consequences of Russia's destruction of the dam and other structures at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. The world needs to know in detail what is happening and what crime against nature and people Russia has committed. I hope the IAEA experts will start working shortly., And of course, our warriors, our heroes. I thank all of you who are now in combat, who are protecting and advancing our positions., For example, the Bakhmut direction - and these are, in particular, the warriors of the 80th separate airborne assault brigade... There is advancement in different areas. I am grateful to you! Thank you for your extraordinary bravery!, The units of the Tavria operational and strategic group of troops - despite extremely fierce fighting, despite the occupiers' air and artillery superiority, they are moving forward! Thank you, warriors! Thank you for every step and for every meter of Ukrainian land that is being liberated from Russian evil. Marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, the 110th separate mechanized brigade, the 128th separate mountain assault brigade, paratroopers of our great ""Seventy-ninth"", artillerymen of the 55th separate brigade "" Zaporizhzhia Sich "". Thank you to all of you! Thank you for your strength!, And I thank everyone in our society who understands that the liberation of our land from such occupiers requires hard, heroic and intensive actions that day after day, step by step, give the necessary power to our offensive!, Glory to Ukrainian heroes! Glory to everyone in the world who helps!, Today I thank the United States for another timely package of defense support. Artillery, armored vehicles, ammunition for our HIMARS. Thank you, America!, Glory to Ukraine!"
12 June 2023  - 22:21 ,"The strength of our warriors yields results, and I thank everyone who is now in combat for this - address by the President of Ukraine",", I wish you health, dear Ukrainians!, I held a meeting of the Staff today. The key reports were from the commanders of the operational directions that are the most important and hottest - Khortytsia and Tavria., The battles are fierce, but we are moving forward, and this is very important. The enemy's losses are exactly what we need. Although the weather is unfavorable these days - the rains make our task more difficult - the strength of our warriors still yields results, and I thank everyone who is in combat now, everyone who supports our combat brigades in the relevant areas., Generals Syrskyi and Tarnavskyi reported today on the successes we have already achieved, on the points of the front where we need reinforcement, and on the actions that can break more Russian positions., Thank you to our guys for every Ukrainian flag that is now returning to its rightful place in the villages of the newly de-occupied territory! Thank you also for the significant replenishment of our exchange fund!, There was a report from the Commander-in-Chief on the general situation, and from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Security Service of Ukraine on stabilization measures in the de-occupied territory. We are working very actively to supply the necessary weapons and ammunition. There was also an intelligence report on the enemy's options. We are maintaining and strengthening our operational dominance., I am particularly grateful for Bakhmut as we are increasing our control in this area., Today's meeting also included a final report on the readiness and non-readiness of shelters across the country, in major cities and in Kyiv. Ministers Klymenko, Kamyshin and Kubrakov reported. The results are disappointing, to say the least. On Friday, relevant draft decisions will be prepared - both on those responsible and on ensuring an adequate level of protection for our people in all Ukrainian cities., I also held several meetings on our international activities. This week, as always, will be very meaningful. First, we are preparing new weapons support from our partners for our warriors. Second, we are preparing to involve more global actors in the implementation of the Peace Formula. Third, we are working to make the Vilnius Summit truly meaningful., I'll let you know every detail., And one more decision worth mentioning. The title of Hero of Ukraine has been posthumously awarded to Lieutenant Colonel of the Security Service of Ukraine Vasyl Bohach. For extraordinary personal bravery, for repeatedly detaining and eliminating enemy saboteurs. For the defense of Mariupol and for such heroism and self-sacrifice, which leave no other option for Ukraine and Ukrainians but victory., Glory to all who are fighting for Ukraine!, Thank you to each and every one who is now in combat, at combat posts and on combat missions! We are moving forward step by step! , We believe in victory. It will come!, Glory to Ukraine!"
11 June 2023  - 21:31 ,It is very important that representatives of international justice have seen with their own eyes the consequences of the Russian act of terrorism at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant - address by the President of Ukraine,", Dear Ukrainians!, Today we managed to return 95 more of our people from Russian captivity, 31 of them are defenders of Mariupol. Most of them are privates and sergeants, two officers. The Armed Forces, the National Guard, the border guards. I am grateful to our team involved in the exchanges: Budanov, Yermak, Malyuk, Lubinets. Thank you for this result. Well done, guys! We have to get every Ukrainian man and woman out of Russian captivity., We are also continuing our rescue operation in the south of Ukraine, and we have managed to evacuate about 4,000 people. Dozens of towns and villages remain flooded, with the worst situation still in the temporarily occupied part of Kherson region., Again and again, we thank our people: the military, police, and rescuers. I would also like to thank volunteers, doctors, local authorities - everyone who is helping to rescue people after the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant disaster, and especially those who are helping to get people out, including those from the occupied territories. It is extremely difficult and dangerous, and it is a special kind of heroism. Thank you for every life saved!, Russian terrorists continue to shell evacuation routes, evacuation points, boats that take people away... Today, as a result of one of these attacks, three people were killed, my condolences to their families and friends... Ten more people were injured, including two police officers. It was an evacuation from Kardashynka, a village on the left bank of Kherson region... The occupiers created this disaster by blowing up a dam, leaving people to their fate in flooded towns and villages, and then shelling the boats that are trying to take people away... Even beasts are more moral than you, Russian state., These days, representatives of the International Criminal Court visited Kherson region. On the very first day after the disaster, the Prosecutor General sent a request to the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to investigate the disaster, and the work has already begun., It is very important that the representatives of international justice have seen the consequences of this Russian act of terrorism with their own eyes and heard for themselves that Russian terror continues. And it continues with the most cynical and brutal shelling of the flooded territory, the evacuation area... We are already facilitating and will continue to facilitate the most independent and objective investigation by the International Criminal Court. All our law enforcement and other institutions are involved in this process to the fullest extent possible. We provide full access to the affected areas, to witnesses, to all information and evidence. This investigation is very important for the security of the whole world., Full and fair accountability for Russian terrorists and the terrorist state itself is a prerequisite for preventing such evil from happening again in the world., Today, our state has taken another sanctions step. Against those who serve the evil that the Russian state has become. Against those who helped to destroy freedom in Russia and play a key role in the repressions on the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine and in Russia itself. 178 of these individuals were added to our sanctions lists at the request of the Security Service of Ukraine. And we will do everything to make sure that each and every one of these accomplices of the Russian dictatorship is held accountable for everything they have done against people and freedom. For every broken destiny and every criminal decision that helped Russia turn into a terrorist state., And one more thing. Of course, I am grateful to our warriors for this day. To each of our combat brigades, each of our units. The Khortytsia and Tavria operational and strategic groups of troops - all those who are now in combat, all those who are in positions, all those who are helping... I thank you! Thank you for every step, for every battle, for every destroyed occupier!, Glory to our heroes! Glory to all who defend the life of Ukraine and Ukrainians!, We will win!, Glory to Ukraine!"
11 June 2023  - 20:12 ,Joint address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau to Canadian journalists at the Press Gallery Dinner in Ottawa,", Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau:, Hello everyone. Bonjour à tous. , I’m pleased to be joining you with my friend, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, tonight., When I realized that I would be missing this year’s Press Gallery Dinner, I wanted to make sure that I could still speak with all of you., Because the work you do is incredibly important. , And because this a scary time for journalists, and for democracies., En ce moment, les médias sont la cible d’attaques et la démocratie est en recul. , Des journalistes se font harceler, censurer, menacer et même tuer. , Des leaders dénigrent votre travail. , Et les gens ont de moins en moins confiance en nos démocraties et nos institutions. , The fourth estate is one of our most important democratic institutions. , We cannot let it be weakened — by cynical politicians or by large corporations who want to shirk their responsibility to pay their fair share., Whether you are a foreign correspondent who helps us see through the fog of war or a local reporter who covers city hall, your work matters. , The stories and facts you report give people the information they need to make choices that affect them, deeply. , Pour que la démocratie fonctionne, on doit tous se fier aux mêmes faits vérifiés. , C’est de cette façon que les gens vont pouvoir comprendre ce qui se passe vraiment et avoir des vrais débats sur la meilleure façon d’avancer., Ça ne pourrait pas être plus vrai ou plus important qu’à ce moment-ci de notre histoire. , L’Ukraine – et les Ukrainiens – le comprennent mieux que quiconque. , Tonight is an opportunity for us to express our gratitude for all those who are shedding a light on Putin’s brutal war. , The brave women and men who continue to put themselves at risk so we may know the true extent of Russia’s crimes. , Tonight, we salute you., A free press is, unequivocally, essential to democracy. And vice versa., You speak truth to power, and you give a voice to the voiceless. , My friends, you make democracy stronger. , And what a privilege it is for us to be able to live and work in a democracy., Partout dans le monde, les populations font d’énormes sacrifices pour avoir ce privilège., Alors, ne tenons jamais pour acquises les libertés que nous offre notre démocratie. , Et continuons de travailler ensemble pour défendre et protéger ces libertés. , I want to close by simply saying thank you., Thank you for everything you do for our country, its people, and for the world., And you know we all talk often about fighting for democracy., Well, I’d like now to turn it to someone who knows a thing or two about fighting for democracy. , Volodymyr!, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy:, Thank you so much, Justin., I greet you all from Ukraine. Thank you for standing with us, with Ukraine., This is often the case – and especially often with journalists and correspondents – when life challenges you to choose to become a hero. Sometimes it is much easier to avoid choosing and stay somewhere in the gray zone between the good and evil – just to pretend to be neutral. But everyone who does not avoid it, who defies the evil, who calls a spade a spade, can become a hero for more than just one day., We live in times when our freedom depends on all of us – when the world should know the whole truth about every crime against freedom in one part of the world to keep the freedom everywhere else. The evil now claims not just one country but values – our values. It claims to destroy them., And I thank you all for not tricking with the evil. , Thank you for telling the truth about Russian war crimes! Thank you for using your power – probably the highest power in the modern world – the power to decide what holds people’s attention and what people know. Thank you for using your power to give guidance for people and humanity., Thank you Canada and you, Justin, my friend, the friend of Ukraine, Mister Prime Minister! Thank you! , Слава Україні!, Justin Trudeau: Героям слава!, Volodymyr Zelenskyy: Thank you!"
10 June 2023  - 18:53 ,Ukrainian sense of international relations is that we should always take care of each other – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, A summary of this day. The first is negotiations with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau., Weapons and ammunition. There is a defense package, in particular, the important 155mm. The coalition of modern fighters and the training of our pilots have the visible progress. The movement towards NATO – in this regard, there is also a result today., I am personally grateful to the Prime Minister and to all Canadians for their unwavering and unequivocal support for our freedom., The consequences of the Russian terrorist attack on the Kakhovka HPP were discussed in detail. Canada is among those who can help us recover from this disaster. We understand each other in the steps that are needed. And they are needed very quickly., Of course, we will not stay away from the disaster Canada is facing now., Massive wildfires, colossal environmental losses, and threats to people... Ukraine is ready to help extinguish fires if Canada needs such international assistance., Our Ukrainian sense of international relations is precisely in the fact that we should always take care of each other when support is needed. And really help., I am sure it will become global principles. Mutual action, mutual support, mutual strength., Now, unfortunately, we see that at some levels in the world, there is simply a shameful indifference to the ecocide and human tragedy caused by the Russian terrorist attack on the Kakhovka HPP., When international organizations that are supposed to protect life on a global scale do not have time to organize and send a rescue mission to the occupied territory even in a week when some world players do not dare to come out even with clear and strong statements that would condemn this new Russian war crime, terrorists are simply fueled by this weakness of the world, this indifference – it encourages them. And we have to overcome this. And we will overcome., We are pressing and encouraging so that international organizations and international support come to the part of Kherson region where the occupiers are now., As of now, over 3,000 people have already been evacuated in Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. But again, it is only a free territory under our control., In the occupied territory, it is only possible to help people in some areas – Russian terrorists are doing everything to make the victims of the disaster as many as possible. Russian shelling continues – even at evacuation points. Russia does not provide any real help to the people in the flooded areas – not for the sake of propaganda, but for the sake of the people..., The Russian state and the Russian leadership should bear separate, fair and strict responsibility for all this., And international organizations should operate in our areas, which we have not yet de-occupied. Every life is important – all of Kherson region, all of the south. Every city and village. We will do everything possible and impossible so that help comes to all our people., I thank each of our rescuers, military and police, local communities, and international organizations currently operating in Kherson region and Mykolaiv region, all our volunteers – each and every one who helps save people, animals, and life in general in the disaster zone... I thank the journalists, who spread the truth and tell the world the stories of people who have suffered., I'm thankful to everyone who helps people after the strikes of Russian missiles and Iranian Shahed drones. Odesa... My condolences to the relatives of those whose lives were taken last night by Russian terror... More than 20 were wounded. Everyone gets help., As every day, thanks go to our soldiers. To everyone who is on the front line, in positions, at combat posts, and on combat missions. Who destroys the enemy on land and protects our sky. I thank everyone who is taking a stand and who is moving forward. Khortytsia, Tavria – thank you to each of our heroes!, Every effort to quickly restore peace to our entire state, every city, every village, every corner of Ukraine., Glory to Ukraine!,  "
9 June 2023  - 20:02 ,"We see heroism of our soldiers and are grateful for every minute of their life, which is the life of Ukraine – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, I just held a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The situation on the front line is the main focus. Reports from commanders of task forces, the Commander-in-Chief, Defense Intelligence, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Strategic Industries, Ministry of Internal Affairs., We focus our attention on all directions where our actions are needed and where the enemy may suffer certain defeats. Our defensive actions, active actions, our gains on the front lines., We discussed in detail the supply and distribution of ammunition, the strengthening of our artillery, and anti-aircraft defense., I spoke today with the Prime Ministers of Japan and the Netherlands., I briefed them on our rescue operation in the southern regions, about our urgent needs. There is a willingness to help Ukraine, and I am grateful to the partners for this. There are decisions regarding humanitarian support packages., With the Prime Minister of Japan, we discussed preparations for the Global Peace Summit and a conference in Japan on the reconstruction and transformation of our country after hostilities., We talked with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands about our further defense cooperation, coordinated our positions before the next Ramstein meeting. We are moving step by step in strengthening our air shield. We discussed the coalition of Patriot systems, the training of our pilots., Today, there is a very important decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands regarding the Scythian gold collection. The Ukrainian collection. The collection kept in our Crimea, but which cannot yet be returned to Crimea for an obvious reason: it cannot be given to the occupier, the robber., Of course, it will be in Crimea, when the Ukrainian flag will also be in Crimea., Actually, the highest court of the Netherlands confirmed this logic. And this is another proof that the Dutch people, the Dutch society and the state really know how to be leaders in defending the rule of law and the values of civilization., I thank everyone who fought for this decision, our team at the Ministry of Justice that worked for this result. We will protect justice step by step., Today, there is also a new security support package from the United States for over $2 billion. Missiles for Patriots and other air defense systems, strengthening our defenses on the ground, enhancing the strength of all our soldiers. Thank you, Mr. President Biden, thank you to both parties of Congress and to all Americans who want freedom to win as much as Ukrainians do., Of course, during the day I receive reports about the rescue operation in Kherson region and Mykolaiv region, about the state of the Kakhovka reservoir – in fact, its remains., An enormous amount of challenges. But we are working to overcome them at all possible levels. And the main thing is that now there is a public potential to do it., Caring for each other, working in unity, protecting people and life. These are our principles, the principles of struggling Ukraine. They, our principles, are now 100 percent effective. And I am sure: no matter how difficult it may be, we will overcome the consequences of this disaster and all Russian evil., I thank everyone in the world who is already helping and who is asking Ukraine how to help. I'm thankful to everyone who is already participating in the rescue operation, who is helping people as best they can. Help people, animals, all living things. I also thank all those who encourage international organizations, foreign leaders, and other states to see what happened and call things by their names. Russian terrorists must be held accountable for everything they have done., And separately – for our soldiers, for all those who are in particularly tough battles these days., We see your heroism, and we are grateful to you for every minute of your life – a life that is truly the life of Ukraine. Because Ukraine is as free as you, our soldiers, are strong. Ukraine is defended as much as you, our soldiers, are effective., Everyone who is fighting now is a fighting Ukraine. Thank you for this! Glory to all who fight and work for our country!, Glory to Ukraine!"
9 June 2023  - 00:32 ,Russia is ruled by savages who themselves are the biggest disaster on the planet - address by the President of Ukraine,", Fellow Ukrainians!, Today was a very long, hard day. Kherson and the region, Mykolaiv region, cities and communities of our Dnipropetrovsk region. Conversations, meetings, evacuation centers, an international appeal., First. We are working at all levels of state and local authorities to rescue as many people as possible from the flooded areas. The evacuation is ongoing. Wherever we can get people out of the flood zone, we do so. The State Emergency Service, police and military are doing a great job! I want to thank each and every one of you who are involved!, Second. There is a presence of international organizations on our free territory, and concrete assistance. In particular, it is the Ukrainian Red Cross and many others. I am grateful to every organization, every volunteer, every company that has really joined the rescue operation., And it is obvious that the absence of some international organizations, such as the International Red Cross, in the disaster zone in the occupied territory, the absence of their assistance to our people in the occupied territory is wrong and is simply self-destruction for such organizations to my mind., Third. Russian terrorists are trying to further aggravate the situation they have caused with their ecocide. This is absolutely deliberate. They continue to shell Kherson and the communities of the region, which have already been flooded by terrorists. They are even shelling evacuation points, which is a manifestation of evil that perhaps no terrorists in the world, except for Russian ones, have ever done., The occupiers have completely abandoned people on the left bank of Kherson region to their fate. The catastrophe has been expanding there for two days now. And this is also an absolutely conscious choice of the Russian leadership. There is no one left in the world today who does not see that Russia is ruled by savages. Savages who themselves are the biggest disaster on the planet today., Together with our partners, we must do everything for the world to prove that it can cope with such disasters, with such terrorists., The situation with drinking water in our cities and communities. Leaders on the ground and in the government know the drill. We have solutions, resources and funds. We will do everything to provide people with drinking water despite this disaster. There may be inconvenience, but we will do everything. Today, I held a separate meeting on water supply and safety of people in the cities and communities of Dnipropetrovsk region - I was there personally. Kryvyi Rih, Marhanets, Nikopol, Pokrov and other communities - we talked about it., The situation with infrastructure and environmental damage. The damage caused by the Russian act of terrorism is very significant, this is clear to everyone. But it should also be clear that there are no alternatives other than maximum recovery and maximum reconstruction. It may be Russia that will be left devastated after Putin, but not Ukraine., And one more thing. Mandatory. Security. I am in constant communication with our military. The commanders of Khortytsia, Tavria, all those involved in the hottest areas. Donetsk region - very tough battles. But there is a result, and I am grateful to everyone who ensures this result! Bakhmut - well done. Step by step. I thank each of our warriors! Avdiivka, Maryinka, the entire east, the situation in the south, the situation after the Russians blew up the dam of our native Kakhovka - we see every detail. But it's not time to talk about it today., Thank you to our people!, Glory to Ukraine!"
8 June 2023  - 21:20 ,It is necessary to consolidate the world for Russia to bear responsibility for ecocide and for Ukraine not to be left alone with this tragedy - President's address to the representatives of the world environmental protection community,", Good evening!, Greetings to all of you!, All of you who did not remain indifferent when you saw this man-made disaster at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant., This is not a natural disaster, not a manifestation of the climate crisis. This disaster is Putin. What he does. What he personally orders to do., The situation is extremely difficult. Russian troops do not stop artillery strikes at the very territory where people are being evacuated. Unfortunately, there are wounded from these terrorist attacks. People who are rescuing and evacuating from the Russian ecocide are also forced to flee from Russian fire! Right at the evacuation points... This Russian crime of ecocide is the largest in Europe in decades, but apparently, the Russian occupiers have decided to further aggravate its consequences., In the occupied part of the territory, where about a dozen settlements are flooded, no evacuation is carried out at all. People have been staying on rooftops, trapped in water for two days, without drinking water, without food or medical care. We do not know the number of dead and injured yet., , Literally every hour we are establishing more and more details about the damage Russia has caused by this disaster. In more than thirty settlements, life is ruined. For hundreds of thousands of people in many towns and villages, access to drinking water has been greatly impeded. Due to the destruction of the dam, fuel storages, warehouses with chemicals, warehouses with fertilizers, animal burial grounds, including at least two ""anthrax burials"" - both in the temporarily occupied territory - were flooded. We do not know what happened to them now. Where there was no centralized sewage system, sewage is already in the water that covers everything..., The number of ecosystems that have been destroyed or pushed to the brink of extinction by this Russian terrorist act is already measured in thousands. More than fifty thousand hectares of forests have been flooded, and at least half of them will die. Tens of thousands of birds and at least twenty thousand wild animals are at risk of death. Obviously, the Kakhovka reservoir has been turned into a large grave for millions of living beings., No nation should be left to face such challenges alone! But there is no answer yet to how we can overcome all this together., First. Of course, we will continue to do everything possible to save as many people as possible. And we need the world's support in this. And not just with rhetoric, but with actions., International organizations have started to help on the territory we control. I am grateful. On the occupied territory, there is zero support. And the longer this goes on, the more victims there will be, unfortunately., There is virtually no attention of international organizations to the occupied territory, which is flooded. And we need, in particular, your pressure on them! Please!, Second. All this we have faced is a deliberate crime of the occupier. There are many questions about what happened. But it happened in the occupied territory. But last year we warned about the occupiers mining the dam and other structures of the plant. But Russian troops are now shelling the areas where the evacuation is underway. Obviously, it is Russia that is interested in the disaster., Just as we have established special Expert Groups to promote sanctions and security guarantees for Ukraine, we are establishing an Expert Group that will primarily focus on consolidating the world so that Russia is fully responsible for the ecocide and so that our country is not left alone with this tragedy - the ecocide. I am sure that with sufficient leadership in the world, the appropriate tools can be created., Third. Any terrorist counts on only a few forms of results for himself: the suffering of people, the intimidation of people, and the ruins that terror leaves behind. This is exactly how Russia is acting in this case as well., , Of course, we will do everything to guarantee people a basis for life even after this disaster. But we need to make sure that there is not a single desert or ruin or dead zone left after this disaster. And this can only be ensured by joint efforts, together with the global environmental protection community, together with policy makers, together with leaders and states, together with international organizations., Pollution and poison from the flooded area quickly gets into the groundwater, poisons the rivers, and from there it enters the Black Sea basin. That is, there is no destruction of nature ""somewhere out there"" – everything in the world is very interconnected., So please spread the truth about this Russian ecocide. Please urge leaders, states and international organizations to act. It is no coincidence that one of the key points in our proposed Peace Formula is to combat ecocide. Please, let's work together to make sure that there are no more ecocides. Join our community, which I mentioned, our platform, our specialists. We are in constant touch., Thank you for your attention!, Glory to Ukraine!"
7 June 2023  - 22:41 ,"International organizations, such as the ICRC, must immediately join the rescue of people in the occupied part of Kherson region – address by the President of Ukraine",", Fellow Ukrainians!, Today, maximum attention is paid to the consequences of the Russian act of terrorism at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. Dozens of settlements on the territory under our control have been flooded. Thousands of houses!, Evacuation continues. Under fire! Russian artillery continues to fire, no matter what. Savages., But as of now, more than 2,000 people have been rescued in Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. And I thank everyone involved in this work, everyone who helps! Our task is to protect lives and help people as much as possible., The situation in the occupied part of Kherson region is absolutely catastrophic. The occupiers simply abandoned people in these terrible conditions. Without rescue, without water, just on the rooftops in flooded communities. And this is another deliberate crime of Russia: after the terrorist state has caused a disaster, it also maximizes the damage from it., Now we need a clear and quick response from the world to what is happening. It is even impossible to establish for sure how many people in the temporarily occupied territory of Kherson region may die without rescue, without drinking water, without food, without medical care. Our military and special services are rescuing people as much as it is possible, despite the shelling. , But large-scale efforts are needed. We need international organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of Kherson region. Each person who dies there is a verdict on the existing international architecture and international organizations that have forgotten how to save lives. If there is no international organization in the area of this disaster now, it means that it does not exist at all, that it is incapable of functioning. All the relevant appeals from Ukraine and our government are in place., Many world leaders, heads of state, governments, and interstate associations have expressed their support for Ukraine and clear condemnation of the Russian crime of ecocide. I am grateful for this principled approach! , Together we must bring the occupiers to justice. They have controlled the dam and the entire hydroelectric power plant for more than a year. Russian propagandists were seriously and openly discussing this very scenario of a man-made disaster, which they caused. Last fall, we warned the world about Russia's mining of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant., We called for both sending an international observation mission to Kakhovka and demining the units and all the plant's facilities. Unfortunately, the world's attention was not enough to ensure all this. Now we must focus the world's attention on eliminating the consequences of another catastrophe caused by Russia, and we must prevent further destructive activity of the occupiers., I had several important international conversations today., Turkish President Erdoğan. I briefed him on the situation in the flooded areas, our rescue operation and urgent needs to help people., Of course, we also discussed the risks to the Zaporizhzhia NPP, which is still under the control of the occupiers. We have an agreement with the head of the IAEA to intensify the work of IAEA representatives at the plant. But it is clear that as long as the occupiers are there, there can be no complete security. Therefore, the de-occupation of Ukraine is a non-alternative task., French President Macron. We discussed in great detail all the consequences of the Russian act of terrorism at the plant and the overall situation. We discussed everything we can do to help people and the affected regions., We also thoroughly discussed defensive actions, as well as international measures that we are preparing in spite of everything, because we need security despite any aggressive and openly insane actions of Russia., Separately, I want to mention a few things that are important for our entire country, and especially for people in those regions of our country that depended on the Kakhovka reservoir., First. We will provide drinking water to everyone. In all regions, districts, cities and villages where it is necessary. All the necessary supply systems will be put in place where there is currently a delivery of drinking water. Sustainability of supply is the main principle., Second. The world will be with us. Our partners are fully informed about what is happening and what kind of help we need. Whatever the economic, social and environmental consequences of this disaster, all the basics of life will be preserved. Kherson, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro regions – we see all the problems and will do everything possible and impossible to solve the problems created by the occupiers., Third. The direct responsibility of state and local authorities in all affected communities and regions is to help people. From the Government and the State Emergency Service to regional authorities and local communities, everyone is involved to the maximum extent possible to save and protect as many people as possible. Everyone should take this task personally. And I am grateful to those who do! Let's take care of each other and Ukraine!, And, of course, today I thank each of our warriors, all units, all brigades that continue to fight the occupiers., The Bakhmut direction, Avdiivka, all of Khortytsia, all of Tavria – great job!, No matter what, every day should be a day of destruction of the enemy., Glory to all our heroes!, Glory to all who care about Ukraine and Ukrainians!, Glory to Ukraine!"
7 June 2023  - 00:00 ,An immediate and maximum global response to Russian terror is needed – address by Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the Russian ecocide caused by the blasting of the Kakhovka HPP,", I address everyone in the world for whom life is a value. Today the Russian occupiers have committed the biggest crime of ecocide on the Ukrainian land – not only during this war, but in decades., In fact, the destroyed Kakhovka reservoir is one of the largest in Ukraine. It holds 18 billion cubic meters of water. All the structures of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant and its dam were located in the occupied territory. Under the full control of the Russian occupiers., Last fall, we had information that the occupiers had mined the dam of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. They did it intentionally. First, to blackmail the world. Second, to blow up the dam and use the flood as a weapon. This is exactly what happened., The flood zone includes areas where more than a hundred thousand people lived before the war. Now, at least tens of thousands of people remain there., , The Kakhovka reservoir provided drinking water to a huge part of Ukraine – cities and villages with hundreds of thousands of people. It also supplied water to farmers for agricultural production in the south and center of Ukraine. Moreover, the destruction of the dam and the reservoir is a man-made strike on the environment, after which nature will have to recover for decades., Evacuation of people from the flooded area is ongoing – almost eighty settlements are under threat. An oil slick of at least 150 tons formed and was taken by the current to the Black Sea. We cannot yet predict how much of the chemicals, fertilizers and oil products stored in the flooded areas will end up in the rivers and sea., As of today, several things are clear. First, such a crime of ecocide could not have happened simply by shelling the dam. To destroy it, Russian forces had to act deliberately – mine, blow up, destroy. Secondly, no country in the world should be left alone against such terror, and I am grateful to everyone who is helping Ukraine! Thirdly, we need an immediate and maximum global response to Russian terror. From the UN Security Council to every international institution. Every state, every leader. Russian terrorists must leave our entire territory, every meter of which they are trying to use for evil and disasters. The faster the de-occupation happens, the faster the security will come., The deliberate destruction of the hydroelectric dam by terrorists looks the same from all corners of the world. For Africa, Europe, the United States, China, Australia, and India, man-made disasters are evil., We must stop the Russian evil. All other terrorists in the world must see that terror is punished by the world., Thank you to everyone who helps us to protect life! , Слава Україні!"
6 June 2023  - 22:26 ,The disaster at the Kakhovka HPP caused by Russian terrorists will not stop Ukraine and Ukrainians – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Dear Ukrainians!, This day, which began with an urgent meeting of the National Security and Defense Council, continued with a meeting of the Staff. We are waiting for a meeting of the UN Security Council., The disaster at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant caused by Russian terrorists will not stop Ukraine and Ukrainians. We will still liberate all our land. And each Russian act of terrorism increases only the amount of reparations that Russia will pay for its crimes, not the chances of the occupiers to stay on our land., First of all, I am grateful to all our rescuers, military, representatives of local communities, each of our regions, who are now helping people from our southern regions flooded by the Russian terrorist attack., Second, the government at all levels is doing everything to save people and provide drinking water to those who received it from the Kakhovka reservoir. Kryvyi Rih and the entire Dnipropetrovsk region, cities and villages in Kherson, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia regions – no matter how difficult it is, we have to help people., Third, I am grateful to everyone who is currently evacuating people from the towns and villages flooded by water from the Kakhovka reservoir. It is very important now to take care of each other and help as much as possible., Fourth, the whole world will know about this Russian war crime, the crime of ecocide. This deliberate destruction of the dam and other HPP facilities by the Russian occupiers is an environmental bomb of mass destruction. For the sake of their own security, the world should now show that Russia will not get away with such terror. And I am grateful to all leaders and states, all nations and international organizations that have supported Ukraine and are ready to help our people and our de-occupation efforts. The Prosecutor General has already appealed to the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to involve international justice in the investigation of the dam explosion., Today I spoke with IAEA Director Grossi, in particular about what happened to the Kakhovka reservoir and the general situation with the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. I called on the IAEA Director to directly and unequivocally condemn today's Russian act of terrorism and to maximize our efforts to liberate the ZNPP. We agreed on his visit to Ukraine., Fifth, it is only the complete liberation of Ukrainian land from Russian occupiers that will guarantee that such acts of terrorism will not happen again. Russia uses anything for terror – any object. The terrorist state must lose., I want to say a few more things separately. Regarding our south and Crimea. We will find a way to restore normal life on our land after the expulsion of the ruscists. This applies to water and everything else. This applies to all our regions – from Kherson to Dnipropetrovsk, from Mykolaiv to Crimea., The fact that Russia deliberately destroyed the Kakhovka reservoir, which is critically important, in particular, for providing water to Crimea, indicates that the Russian occupiers have already realized that they will have to flee Crimea as well., Well, Ukraine will get back everything that belongs to it. And it will make Russia pay for what it has done., Glory to all our people who are fighting and working for the sake of our country and our people!, Today, just like yesterday, I would like to celebrate our heroes in the Bakhmut sector... Well done, warriors! The 3rd separate assault brigade and the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade - thank you! Thank you for moving forward!, Glory to Ukraine!"
6 June 2023  - 14:45 ,"This year in Vilnius, it is necessary to finally establish that Ukraine will be a member of NATO – address by the President of Ukraine to the participants of the Bucharest Nine Summit",", Thank you very much, dear colleagues! , First of all, I would like to thank you, dear Zuzana, Klaus, Andrzej, for the invitation. , Jens, Mr. Secretary General! , And dear participants!, Today, Russian terrorists have once again proved that they are a threat to everything living. Last night they blew up the dam of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, at 2:50 am this explosion happened. It was an absolutely deliberate, prepared explosion. They knew exactly what they were doing., Just imagine the volume of water held by this dam. It was one of the largest reservoirs in Ukraine., The flooding of the southern regions of our country has been ongoing since this night. At least 100 thousand people lived in these areas before the Russian invasion. At least tens of thousands are still there., 80 towns and villages are under water. Evacuation has already begun. And these are just the initial consequences. Unfortunately, the tragedy is much broader., , The Kakhovka reservoir was a source of drinking water for millions of people. Now, instead of a water supply system, there is only a water truck. Imagine that for cities with tens or hundreds of thousands of people., The Kakhovka reservoir was a source of water for farming and agricultural production. Huge areas are now without irrigation. And now it is even difficult to determine what the consequences for the environment will be..., Russia has detonated a bomb of mass environmental destruction. And this is a real ecocide!, Of course, all our services, all those who can rescue people, are already involved. But only on the territory controlled by Ukraine., Unfortunately, Russia has been controlling this dam and the entire Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant for more than a year. And it is physically impossible to blow it up somehow from the outside, by shelling. It was mined. It was mined by the Russian occupiers. And they blew it up., And this once again demonstrates the cynicism with which Russia treats the people whose land it has captured, and what Russia actually brings to Europe and the world., This is the largest man-made environmental disaster in Europe in decades. And it is the most dangerous terrorist in the world. And that is why Russia's defeat – a defeat that we will ensure anyway – will be the most significant contribution to the security of our region, our Europe and the entire world., Dear ladies and gentlemen!, Of course, we will mobilize all possible support now, after such a Russian attack on people and nature. And I am grateful to all the leaders, states, and international organizations that have already condemned this Russian terrorist attack., And we have called for the UN Security Council to be convened and we will reach out to everyone who is able to bring Russia to legal and fair accountability for this terror. But to truly guarantee security, we need more than that., , As long as the terrorist state still hopes to recoup somehow, as long as Russia still knows that doubts and fears remain somewhere here in Europe, we are all in danger. Because security is always a certainty, and it is always a foregone conclusion that those who encroach on security will lose., We are moving on the ground, liberating our people from the Russian occupation., We are creating an air shield that protects lives from attacks by Russian missiles and Iranian drones., We are creating the coalition of Patriots to show everyone, all potential aggressors in the world, that free nations have effective weapons to defend themselves against any missile., We are also creating a new coalition of fighter jets that will protect our people from Russian guided bombs and other forms of Russian aviation terror., I am confident that we will find a way to counter Russia's environmental terror as well., However, don't we know what constantly fuels Russian revanchism? What motivates Moscow to try to take control of this or that part of Europe through terror, disasters, corruption, and blackmail? We know this for sure., This is the belief of Russia's rulers that Europe will allegedly show weakness. Weakness is the main hope and bet of terrorists., Unfortunately, for years, security uncertainty has persisted in Europe – to whom NATO's doors are actually open. Are they open to all free nations?, At this year's NATO Summit in Vilnius, it is time to show that NATO's declared values and real values do not differ. It is time to show that there will be no weakness in Europe. How many more disasters will it take for a terrorist state to finally see that terror is not a tool to influence NATO's decisions?, , And that's why Russia needs these disasters – the Kremlin wants to constrain us with them, and constrain you all. I am grateful to you, dear leaders, I am grateful to you, Jens, for standing up to this. Your rhetoric and actions are exactly what all our allies and partners need. This is what is needed to protect against terror and disasters. To defend against Russia., I thank all of you who help us fight against the Russian occupiers. I thank all of you who help us increase the world's pressure on Russia for its terror. I thank all of you who help prepare the real content for this year's NATO Summit., It is necessary to finally establish that Ukraine will be a member of NATO, and this can only be established by an invitation to Ukraine to join. Finally, it is necessary to determine the algorithm of when and as a result of what steps such accession will take place., Finally, security guarantees for Ukraine on its way to NATO should be formalized., When this happens, it will immediately deprive Russian revanchism of its purpose. Those who destroy must be destroyed themselves., Terror must lose. And we have to ensure that with every step we take, every choice we make, and every summit we organize., Thank you again, Zuzana! Thank you all, colleagues, for the invitation. Thank you for your attention! Thank you for your support!, Glory to Ukraine!"
5 June 2023  - 21:55 ,The enemy knows that Ukraine will win – address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy,", Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!, A report on the day., First of all, I am grateful to each of our warriors, to all our defenders who gave us the news we expect. Bakhmut direction – well done, warriors!, We see how hysterically Russia perceives every step we take there, every position we take., The enemy knows that Ukraine will win. They see it. They feel it thanks to your strikes, soldiers, and in particular in Donetsk region. Thank you for that!, Today, I would like to particularly celebrate several combat units of ours. These are the 5th separate assault brigade and the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade, which skillfully, decisively and efficiently defend our positions, destroying the occupiers and, most importantly, moving forward., Thank you, warriors! Thank you all!, Second, we continue our work on sanctions against Russia., Although the global trend is clear – Russia will lose this war, Russia's rulers continue to deny reality. They continue to try to deceive the world, to circumvent sanctions, to produce more weapons, to ensure more resources and people are spent on this aggression. , We are preparing our steps, new steps to further limit Russia's military potential. Everyone in the world who helps the terrorist state circumvent sanctions in one way or another, everyone in the world whom Russia uses for the supply of weapons, components, equipment – each such entity must feel the full force of the free world. , And we will ensure this., It is a common task of the world to stop terror. And the main prerequisite for fulfilling this task is to stop any ways in which terrorists are still trying to get something for themselves. , More news to come soon., Third. Today I held a long and very informative meeting on the transformation of our country and our lives – now and after the victory., Objectively, there are fundamental security, economic, energy, technological, and simply human issues that require full and effective answers., These answers will determine what Ukraine will be like and what life will be like for Ukrainian children when they become adults and inherit the state from the current generations., A strong state, a free state, a modern state, a state pleasant to live in., We are laying the foundation for this now. Everyone who fights for Ukraine. Everyone who works for Ukraine. Everyone who helps., For example, today the government, the Office, and the National Security and Defense Council discussed the energy sector and agricultural production in a broad sense. Not only restoring what Ukraine had, but developing and expanding it, taking into account Ukraine's global role for the food and energy security of Europe and the world., We will present all these details. It will be thorough. In particular, we will present them at the London International Conference on the Reconstruction of Ukraine, which will take place this month., And, of course, we do not stop our international work with partners for a single day., Today the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was in Kyiv. A good meeting, useful negotiations and a new strengthening of our countries and our security., I thanked for all the defense support provided to Ukraine, and especially for the Storm Shadow missiles, which have proven to be extremely effective on the frontline. We continued the conversation about a new coalition to protect life – the Patriot Coalition. Step by step, we are moving with our partners to make this coalition as effective in protecting life and freedom as all our other defense coalitions that have already been established., We also talked with Mr. Secretary of State about preparations for the NATO Summit in Vilnius. The Summit must be meaningful. Then it will become historic., Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine! Thank you to everyone who is bringing the defeat of Russian terror closer!, Glory to our warriors! , Glory to all our heroes!, Glory to Ukraine!"
4 June 2023  - 20:02 ,"The time will come when children on Earth, including those in Ukraine, will be protected from such evil as Russian - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy",", Dear Ukrainians!, The rescue operation in the town of Pidhorodne, Dnipro region, where a Russian missile destroyed houses, has already been completed., 25 people were injured, five of them children. Davyd, who is 6 years old, is in serious condition and hospitalized. Denys, 11, is also in serious condition and hospitalized. Oleksandr, 15, is also in serious condition. Liza, 17 years old, is undergoing outpatient treatment. Kira, 10 years old, has a mine-blast injury, she is undergoing outpatient treatment. It is painful to see such reports., Liza, a 2-year-old girl, was killed by this Russian missile. Probably an Iskander missile. My condolences to the family and friends..., The Russian terror has claimed the lives of hundreds of our children, and only since February 24, during the full-scale war, we know for sure that 485 children have been killed. This is a number that we can officially confirm, knowing the data of each child., Unfortunately, the real number is higher. Every time we liberate our land from the Russian occupiers, we learn the terrible truth about the occupation. About how many people, how many children are buried in the occupied territory - in the graves of this war, this aggression. And how many more are still under the ruins in Ukrainian cities and villages burned by Russia., So far, unfortunately, we do not have complete information about the hundreds of thousands of children who were deported to Russia. As of today, thanks to various efforts, 371 children have been returned to Ukraine from deportation. At the same time, we know for sure about at least 19,505 deported Ukrainian children, and this is only a part of all our little Ukrainians who are still in the hands of the enemy. We must return them all., Today in our country is the day of remembrance for children who died as a result of Russian aggression. Since 2014. Children who would have been alive if a bunch of thugs in the Kremlin, in Moscow, hadn't considered themselves chieftains who allegedly had the right to decide the fate of nations., Each of these bandits will be convicted. I have no doubt about it. All the necessary legal institutions are working for this result., And today, on this day of remembrance, I want to thank everyone in the world who supports our efforts for justice. For the sake of punishing everyone who brought terror to our land, everyone who kills and deports children and adults., I am grateful to everyone in the world who helps the work of the International Criminal Court and its team in investigating Russian crimes on Ukrainian soil. And who helps us organize a special tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine - for the original crime that gave rise to all the other terrible crimes of this war., Let the verdicts against the ruscists that they will one day hear in the dock - lawful and just verdicts - be evidence that the world will still protect life, protect civilization. And that the time will come when children on Earth - in Ukraine and elsewhere - will be protected from such evil as Russian evil and from such aggressions., That is why it is so important that the power of justice, the power of accountability, be a powerful reminder of every life that was taken by evil, by Russia., And today part of this accountability - a mandatory part - is sanctions. Sanctions from the world that make Russia pay the price for what it is doing. Sanctions that should limit Russia's capacity for terror to the maximum., Today I held a special meeting on sanctions. The Main Intelligence Directorate, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Government, the Office. We analyzed in great detail how Russia circumvents sanctions and who helps it. Different countries, different companies, without which Russia would not be able to produce terrorist weapons, including missiles. Unfortunately, the terrorist state manages to use the technologies of the world through a network of suppliers, and manages to circumvent international sanctions regimes., We see every direction of circumvention of existing sanctions, every country whose territory or jurisdiction, whose citizens are used by Russia to continue terror. And we must close all such areas - together with our partners - to ensure that Russian missiles and weapons do not contain products of the free world. The necessary steps will be taken., Thank you to everyone who helps us fight the evil of aggression!, Glory to all our warriors! And thank you for this day on the frontline., Glory to Ukraine!"
3 June 2023  - 22:39 ,Please don't forget to thank our warriors in person – address of President of Ukraine,", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, Almost every evening, in my addresses, I thank our warriors – particular units, particular brigades, which distinguished themselves the most on the front line or in the defense of our sky in a day or in a week., And today – more personal words of gratitude to particular warriors., We should all remember that our defense, our active actions, and the independence of Ukraine are not something abstract. These are very particular people, particular actions of particular heroes, thanks to which Ukraine exists and Ukraine will exist. Thousands and thousands of our strongest, bravest, most accurate people..., Such as soldier Yaroslav Kan, our paratrooper. He fought in the most fiercely embattled spots of the front. Bilohorivka, defense of Lysychansk, defense of Soledar. Battles for Svatove, Kreminna, Bakhmut... Four wounds! Now, he is undergoing treatment, recovering. And ready to return to the front again. It is an extraordinary human power! Thank you, Yaroslav!, Senior Sergeant Yevhen Kepsha, commander of the squad of the anti-tank missile systems platoon. Battles for Bakhmut. Stugna anti-tank guided missile system. Very accurate, very brave. Together with the boys, together with the brothers from his squad have very good results in destroying the occupiers. Thanks for this, Yevhen!, Senior Sergeant Maksym Kuzmenko and Junior Sergeant Anton Andrushchenko are soldiers of the 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade. Battles near Avdiyivka. Very tough fights. Continuous enemy assaults. And this is the result Ukraine needs in defense of our positions. Thank you, guys!, I have already thanked our soldiers from the 55th Zaporizhzhia Sich Artillery Brigade many times. All guys are great. They fight mightily, very efficiently. And today, I will especially mention the artillery company under the command of Captain Mykola Nosach. Avdiyivka direction. They fight off Russian assaults very skillfully. Exactly what is needed.

A guy who knows how to shoot down Russian missiles extremely well – and with the help of just an Igla MANPADS. Thank you for this accuracy!, We usually thank the warriors who defend our cities from Russian terror with the help of powerful air defense systems: Patriot, NASAMS, IRIS, and others. And it is absolutely fair – they saved a lot of lives of our people, a lot of infrastructure facilities., However, soldiers of our fire maneuver groups, which defend various civilian and military facilities, are important – and effective! As, for example, Senior Sergeant Viktor Sidnev is the senior of one of these maneuver groups defending Kyiv. Excellent coordination of actions, excellent combat skills.

2 June 2023  - 19:50 ,Ukrainian air shield must continuously have all it needs – President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address,", Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!, A summary of the day., The first thing was to hold the Supreme Commander-in-Chief's Staff meeting. Urgent security issues. An obviously harsh response to the death of people in Kyiv due to a closed shelter. I gave instructions for having the shelter facilities in Kyiv and throughout the country inspected. Ministers Kamyshin and Klymenko are in charge of this., Unfortunately, even today – after everything has happened – Kyiv residents repeatedly post information about the lack of access to shelters. Not just about closed shelters but about brewed entrances to shelters, about the absence of shelters at all in some parts of the city. This level of negligence in the city cannot be covered with any excuses., All the details regarding our air defense system – its further development, supply, and production of the necessary missiles in Ukraine were also discussed at the Staff meeting. The Ukrainian air shield must continuously have all it needs. We are engaged in the coalition of Patriot systems and the coalition of modern fighters – actively every day., The situation on the front line was discussed carefully in detail, in all those points where it is the toughest situation now. I will not talk about it in more detail – the actions of our state, the active actions of our troops will say what is needed. And I separately held a meeting devoted to the training of our new brigades, those that are accumulating strength from the north to the south of our country., The second item for today – negotiations with the President of Estonia, who arrived in Kyiv. Security comes first, and that's what's about our defense now, and what's about our long-term security. Estonia fundamentally helps us with weapons and equipment, supports our movement in NATO, it is aware of how crucial it is that we prevail over ruscism right now and on our Ukrainian land. It is crucial for every nation neighboring a terrorist state. I'm sure we will provide this security, which is so necessary, we will provide victory over Russian aggression to Ukraine, all of Europe and the free world., It is also noteworthy that we are developing our cooperation with Estonia and the export of solutions – our digital solutions. Earlier, it was from Estonia that Ukrainians took an example in the development of digital solutions. And now, we have reached such a level that on the basis of our Ukrainian Diia a government application will be created in Estonia. What is convenient and useful for millions of Ukrainians will obviously be convenient and useful for other nations. And it is another component of our leadership, Ukrainian leadership. We discussed further cooperation with Mr. President of Estonia, in particular, in digitalization., And, by the way, I will make the following announcement: Diia will help develop government services in other countries, not only in Europe – in Latin America and Africa., The third for today from the various activities worth saying. I held several meetings, long and meaningful, regarding shaping our comprehensive policy for the future. The things that concern the further transformation of the state. The things that concern our participation in global processes. As always, we are preparing news and solutions that will give Ukraine and Ukrainians even more strength., I'm thankful to everyone who helps our country! Glory to all our warriors! To everyone who is currently fighting for Ukraine., Today, I especially want to mention the 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigade – all the soldiers of this brigade, who are is extremely resistant in defending the Svatove direction and successfully repelling enemy attacks while moving forward. Thank you, warriors!, Avdiyivka direction... 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade – thank you, soldiers, for your bravery and your ability to be strong in destroying the invaders. Well done!, I would like to mention the border guards who proudly defend the state on the front lines together with all our defense and security forces. Lviv, Donetsk, Zhytomyr border guard units fighting at the front. Thank you! And I also thank the soldiers of the Chernihiv border detachment, who are actively opposing the Shahed drones. The speed and accuracy of our soldiers are critical. Thank you, warriors, for your speed and for your accuracy!, Today, I signed the decrees on honoring our soldiers with state awards. A total of 263 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine., Glory to all our heroes!, Glory to Ukraine!"
1 June 2023  - 21:38 ,The duty of local authorities is to ensure the availability and accessibility of shelters around the clock – address by the President of Ukraine,", Dear Ukrainians!, This long and hard day is coming to an end., First of all, my condolences to the families and friends of those whose lives were taken by Russia, taken by Russian strikes., We are doing our best to protect people. There was no such international meeting, no such international negotiations where the issue of air defense for Ukraine was not raised., But protecting people means protecting them at all levels. Shelters must be accessible. The situation like last night in Kyiv, when people came to the shelter and the shelter was closed, should never happen again. It is the duty of local authorities, a very specific duty, to ensure that shelters are available and accessible around the clock. It is painful to see the negligence of this duty. It is painful to see casualties. And if the duty is not fulfilled on the ground, it is the direct responsibility of law enforcement bodies to bring to justice., Today, our country, like many other countries, marks Children's Day. But even on this day, the terrorist state took the life of a Ukrainian child. But even on this day, Russia shelled our cities - from Kharkiv to Kherson, from Kyiv to Donbas. But we used this day to the maximum to bring the terrorists' defeat closer. And this day has become a time when we are bringing Russia's accountability – accountability of every murderer, every terrorist – closer., This morning, our Ukrainian delegation was in Moldova for the Summit of the European Political Community. This is the center of political discussions on our continent now. We had very important negotiations. The President of Moldova and the President of France, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the President of the European Commission, the President of Romania and the Prime Minister of Portugal, the Prime Minister of Albania and the Prime Minister of North Macedonia, the Prime Minister of Italy, the Prime Minister of Spain, the President of Switzerland, the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, the President of Azerbaijan, the Chancellor of Germany., There was also an expanded format with representatives from the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, UK, Poland and Belgium. And, of course, there were meetings on the sidelines of the Summit and a joint meeting of all the participants..., We are preparing new defense decisions for Ukraine, including air defense, aviation, and our advance on the ground. We are preparing real political content for the NATO Summit in Vilnius. We are preparing a package of security guarantees for our country on its way to the Alliance. We are doing everything to bring the EU's political decision on membership for Ukraine closer. We are preparing a Peace Summit based on the Ukrainian Peace Formula., And I thank all the leaders, all the countries that support us on these points. This is not only support for Ukraine, it is support for real security for the whole of Europe., I would like to thank Mrs. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, for supporting our initiatives to protect our children, to find and return those young Ukrainians who were deported to Russia. We have to return them all, we have to do everything possible and impossible to protect all our people – to the maximum extent possible – from any Russian threats. I am confident that this is possible., I would like to thank President Michel, President of the European Council, who today held a special security session at the summit., I would also like to thank Roberta Metsola, President of the European Parliament, for the decision on ammunition for Ukraine – for supporting the allocation of additional 500 million euros for this purpose. Thank you!, Thank you to all our warriors! Thank you to everyone who trains our warriors! Who helps us with weapons! Who provides treatment for our heroes after their injuries! I thank all the rescuers, all our employees of the State Emergency Service and other services who are eliminating the consequences of Russian strikes! Thank you to all the volunteers who help our warriors, our people, our country!, I thank everyone with whom we are walking side by side towards our victory, towards our peace and towards punishment for Russian terrorists., Glory to Ukraine!"
1 June 2023  - 15:45 ,Every doubt in Europe is a trench that Russia will definitely try to occupy – speech by the President of Ukraine at the second meeting of the European Political Community,", Madam President of Moldova, , Mr. President of the European Council, , Dear colleagues!, Today, and every time we prepare and make decisions for the sake of our Europe, for the sake of our values, we must remember that every doubt we show here in Europe is a trench that Russia will definitely try to occupy. Whether these doubts are about vital security steps, or doubts about our unity, or maybe about our ability to meet the challenges of our time… every doubt brings more insecurity., Here in Moldova, luckily, we don't hear air raid sirens or the sound of Russian artillery. But not so long ago, Russia's rulers were, unfortunately, convinced that between the evil they brought to Ukraine and the occupation of Moldova, there were only a few days, a week at most., And now they think the same way. But we act, we all, and this brings more security., Since February 24 last year, the limits of security in Europe have in fact been the limits of our determination, our ability to act together for the sake of the interests of our peoples and the whole Europe. As much as we can reject doubts, we can reject the evil of aggression., There is no one among us who does not know what solutions Europe needs now., The first is a full-fledged defense against Russian terror. Both on the ground and in the sky. , , Russian missiles claimed three more lives this night in our capital, in Kyiv, ten injured. One child killed – in addition to the hundreds killed by Russian terror earlier! At least 484 Ukrainian children killed by Russia., There are two decisive components now: a coalition of “Patriots” that will put an end to Russian blackmail by ballistic missiles, and a coalition of modern fighter jets that will prove that terror against our cities has no chance. And I thank those who are helping, those who understand that every step in air defense enforcement is literally saving lives, and the speed of forming these two coalitions – the coalition of “Patriots” and the coalition of modern fighter jets – , is literally accelerating peace., The second is the full power of our unity. We do see who the aggressor is. We see where the aggression is taking place. Russia is afraid of NATO – it’s true – and tries to swallow only those who are outside of the common security space. And Russia tries to leave a “frozen” war on the territory of its neighbors if it fails to swallow the entire neighboring country. , For example, why is the Russian contingent still in Transnistria? The Kremlin only needs it to unfreeze its attack on Moldova one day. How long will Europe tolerate this? This question is already more than thirty years old. And it is worth answering., There should be no place for any ""frozen"" or hot war on our continent!, Recently, a Chinese journalist asked me – why NATO. The answer is simple: when there are no security guarantees, there are only war guarantees. We haven’t heard about the possibility of the security alliance between China plus NATO plus Ukraine… But we need peace, just peace. That is why every European country that borders Russia and that does not want Russia to tear it apart, should be a full member of the EU and NATO. And there are only two alternatives to this – either an open war or a creeping Russian occupation., We see what is happening in Belarus. We see what is happening in Georgia. We see how these nations are being dragged, although in different ways, into the same state of , lawlessness. But what do they see? , If even Ukrainians, who are proving our commitment to freedom and the values of a united Europe with blood, have not yet heard a clear positive answer about joining the EU and NATO, the hopes of others are becoming completely elusive. Think about this disappointment – the disappointment of both our soldiers who are fighting for freedom and those nations for whom our struggle in Ukraine is their hope., This year – is for decisions. And this is the third point I would like to emphasize. , , In summer – in Vilnius, at the NATO summit – the clear invitation to membership for Ukraine is needed, and the security guarantees on the way to NATO membership are needed. In fall, on our accession to the EU – clear positive decision is needed. And we are also preparing the Peace Summit, which will guide the world majority to implement the joint Peace Formula, and it is a global need. The time has come, and the doubts must vanish., Positive decisions for Ukraine will be positive decisions for everyone. A security basis. Obviously, for Moldova. It’s very important. In the long run – for Georgia. I have no doubt that over time – for Belarus as well. And thus, for European peace. Because there will be no trench of doubt for aggression against anyone in Europe. , And I thank all of you who understand that Europe must be so far-sighted to be truly peaceful., The Ukrainian approach is obvious and the most open. We openly proposed the Peace Formula, and its points are obvious. We speak openly about the importance of NATO and the direct link between the reduction of our doubts and the expansion of our space of real security. We openly say that only a strong air defense, namely the coalition of “Patriots”, namely the coalition of modern fighter jets can defeat Russian terror. It’s real life in which we live and fight every day. This is the openness on which our Europe is based, one of our main joint principles. These are facts, obvious facts. Openness and honesty. Now we need decisions., Thank you very much for the invitation, Maia! Thank you very much for hosting us! Thank you for your attention!, Long live Europe! , Salut Moldova!, Слава Україні!"
